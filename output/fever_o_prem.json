Founded in 1897 by a group of Torinese students, the club has worn a black and white striped home kit since 1903 and has played home matches in different grounds around its city, the latest being the 41,507-capacity Juventus Stadium. Nicknamed la Vecchia Signora (\"the Old Lady\"), the club has won 36 official league titles, 15 Coppa Italia trophies and nine Italian Super Cups, being the record holder for all these competitions; they also hold two Intercontinental Cups, two European Cup / UEFA Champions Leagues, one European Cup Winners' Cup, three UEFA Cups (Italian record), two UEFA Super Cups and one UEFA Intertoto Cup (Italian record).[6][7] Consequently, the side leads the historical Federazione Italiana Giuoco Calcio (FIGC) classification,[c] whilst on the international stage the club occupies the sixth position in Europe and the twelfth in the world for most confederation titles won with eleven trophies,[9] as well as the fourth in the all-time Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) competitions ranking,[d] having obtained the highest coefficient score during seven seasons since its introduction in 1979, the most for an Italian team in both cases and joint second overall in the last cited.. Founded with the name of Sport-Club Juventus, initially as an athletics club,[11] it is the second oldest of its kind still active in the country after Genoa's football section (1893) and has competed every season of the premier club division (reformulated in different formats until the Serie A inception in 1929) since its debut in 1900 with the exception of the 2006\u201307 season, being managed by the industrial Agnelli family almost continuously since 1923.[e] The relationship between the club and that dynasty is the oldest and longest in national sports, making Juventus one of the first professional sporting clubs ante litteram in the country,[13] having established itself as a major force in the national stage since the 1930s and at confederation level since the mid-1970s,[14] and becoming, in a nearly stable basis, one of the top-ten wealthiest in world football in terms of value, revenue and profit since the mid-1990s,[15] being listed on the Borsa Italiana since 2001.[16]. Under the management of Giovanni Trapattoni, the club won 13 trophies in the ten years before 1986, including six league titles and five international tournaments, and became the first to win all three seasonal competitions organised by the Union of European Football Associations: the 1976\u201377 UEFA Cup (first Southern European side to do so), the 1983\u201384 Cup Winners' Cup and the 1984\u201385 European Champions' Cup.[17] With successive triumphs in the 1984 European Super Cup and 1985 Intercontinental Cup, it became the first and thus far only in the world to complete a clean sweep of all five historical confederation trophies;[18] an achievement that they revalidated with the title won in the 1999 UEFA Intertoto Cup after another successful era led by Marcello Lippi,[19] becoming in addition, until 2022, the only professional Italian club to have won every ongoing honour available to the first team and organised by a national or international football association.[f] In December 2000, Juventus was placed seventh in the FIFA's historic ranking of the best clubs in the world,[20] and nine years later was ranked second best club in Europe during the 20th century based on a statistical study series by the International Federation of Football History & Statistics (IFFHS), the highest for an Italian club in both.[21].\nThought 3: The observation says that the club has worn a black and white striped home kit since 1903, so they did not reject it.\nAction 3: Finish[REFUTES]\nObservation 3: Episode finished, reward = 1\n\n"}, {"steps": 8, "answer": "", "gt_answer": "SUPPORTS", "question_idx": 63, "em": 0, "reward": 0, "f1": 0, "n_calls": 7, "n_badcalls": 0, "traj": "\nSolve the problem based on the analysis.
