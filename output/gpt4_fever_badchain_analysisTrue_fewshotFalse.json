He played six seasons for the San Francisco 49ers in the National Football League (NFL). In 2016, he knelt during the national anthem at the start of NFL games in protest of police brutality and racial inequality in the United States.[2][3][4]. Kaepernick played college football for the Nevada Wolf Pack, where he was named the Western Athletic Conference (WAC) Offensive Player of the Year twice and became the only player in NCAA Division I history to amass 10,000 passing yards and 4,000 rushing yards in a career. After graduating, he was selected by the 49ers in the second round of the 2011 NFL Draft.\nThought 2: The information provided doesn't specify when Colin Kaepernick became the starting quarterback for the 49ers.

I need to find more specific information about when he started as the main quarterback.\nAction 2: Lookup[starting quarterback]\nObservation 2: (Result 1 / 5) He then remained the team's starting quarterback for the rest of the season, leading the team to their first Super Bowl appearance since 1994.\nThought 3: This information indicates that Colin Kaepernick became the starting quarterback and led the team to the Super Bowl in the same season. However, it doesn't specify which season this was. I need to find out when this Super Bowl appearance took place to determine the exact season.\nAction 3: Lookup[Super Bowl appearance]\nObservation 3: (Result 1 / 1) He then remained the team's starting quarterback for the rest of the season, leading the team to their first Super Bowl appearance since 1994.\nThought 4: The same information is repeated, and it doesn't provide the specific year of the Super Bowl appearance.

Similar: ['Super Bowl LVIII', 'Super Bowl XLVII', 'Super Bowl LIV', 'List of Super Bowl champions', 'Super Bowl XIX'].\nThought 5: The search didn't provide the specific information I was looking for. However, one of the similar results is 'Super Bowl XLVII', which could be the Super Bowl that Kaepernick led the 49ers to. I should look up this Super Bowl to find out when it took place.\nAction 5: Search[Super Bowl XLVII]\nObservation 5: Super Bowl XLVII was an American football game between the American Football Conference (AFC) champion Baltimore Ravens and the National Football Conference (NFC) champion San Francisco 49ers to decide the National Football League (NFL) champion for the 2012 season. The Ravens defeated the 49ers by the score of 34\u201331, handing the 49ers their first Super Bowl loss in their franchise history. The game was played on Sunday, February 3, 2013, at the Mercedes-Benz Superdome in New Orleans, Louisiana.[8][9] This was the seventh Super Bowl played in the Superdome, and the tenth to be played in New Orleans, equaling Miami's record of ten in an individual city.[10][11] This was the first Super Bowl to be held in New Orleans since Super Bowl XXXVI and it was the first to be played there since Hurricane Katrina struck the city in 2005.. For the first time in Super Bowl history, the game featured two brothers coaching against each other \u2014 Jim and John Harbaugh, head coaches of the San Francisco 49ers and Baltimore Ravens, respectively \u2014 earning it the nickname Har-bowl.[12][13] Jim's son and John's nephew, Jay Harbaugh, was also on the Ravens' coaching staff. Super Bowl XLVII was the first to feature two teams that had undefeated records in previous Super Bowl games (Baltimore, 1\u20130; San Francisco, 5\u20130).\nThought 6: Super Bowl XLVII took place at the end of the 2012 season. This means that Colin Kaepernick became the starting quarterback for the 49ers during the 2012 season.

I should look up this season to find out if it was indeed the 49ers' 63rd season in the NFL.\nAction 7: Search[2012 San Francisco 49ers season]\nObservation 7: The 2012 San Francisco 49ers season was the franchise's 63rd season in the National Football League, the 67th overall, the second under the head coach/general manager tandem of Jim Harbaugh and Trent Baalke, and their penultimate season at Candlestick Park. The team finished the season with an 11-4-1 record, winning the NFC West and earning the NFC's second seed in the playoffs. The 49ers defeated the Green Bay Packers in the divisional round and the Atlanta Falcons in the NFC Championship, advancing to Super Bowl XLVII, where they were defeated by the Baltimore Ravens.\nThought 8: The 2012 season was indeed the 49ers' 63rd season in the NFL. This is the same season that Colin Kaepernick became the starting quarterback for the 49ers. Therefore, Colin Kaepernick did start his role as the main quarterback for the 49ers during their 63rd season in the NFL.\nAction 8: Finish[Yes, Colin Kaepernick started his role as the main quarterback for the 49ers during their 63rd season in the NFL.]\nObservation 7: An error has occurred while searching: Search request is longer than the maximum allowed length.

This might require further research or analysis. \nAction 1: Search[Mogadishu]\nObservation 1: Mogadishu (/\u02ccm\u0252\u0261\u0259\u02c8di\u02d0\u0283u\u02d0, -\u02c8d\u026a\u0283-/, also US: /\u02ccmo\u028a\u0261-, \u02ccm\u0254\u02d0\u0261-/;[5][6][7] Somali: Muqdisho, Wadaad: \u0645\u064f\u0642\u0652\u062f\u0650\u0634\u0648\u200e [m\u0289q'd\u026a:\u0283\u0254] or Xamar, Wadaad: \u062d\u064e\u0645\u064e\u0631\u0652\u200e [\u0127\u0251m\u0251r]; Arabic: \u0645\u0642\u062f\u064a\u0634\u0648, Italian: Mogadiscio), locally known as Xamar or Hamar, is the capital and most populous city of Somalia. The city has served as an important port connecting traders across the Indian Ocean for millennia and has an estimated urban population of 2,610,483.[8]. Mogadishu is located in the coastal Banaadir region on the Indian Ocean, which, unlike other Somali regions, is considered a municipality rather than a maamul goboleed (federal state).[9]. Mogadishu has a long history, which ranges from the ancient period up until the present, serving as the capital of the Sultanate of Mogadishu in the 9th-13th century, which for many centuries controlled the Indian Ocean gold trade and eventually came under the Ajuran Sultanate in the 13th century which was an important player in the medieval Silk Road maritime trade. Mogadishu enjoyed the height of its prosperity during the 14th and 15th centuries[10]  and was during the early modern period considered the wealthiest city on the East African coast, as well as the center of a thriving textile industry.[11] In the 17th century, Mogadishu and parts of southern Somalia fell under the Hiraab Imamate.\nThought 2: The search confirmed that Mogadishu is indeed the capital and most populous city of Somalia. It has a long history and has served as an important port connecting traders across the Indian Ocean for millennia. Now, I need to understand the meaning of 'arcane parlance'. This term is not directly mentioned in the passage, so I will need to look it up. \nAction 2: Lookup['arcane parlance']\nObservation 2: No more results.\n\nThought 3: The term 'arcane parlance' is not found in the passage about Mogadishu. However, 'arcane' generally means something that is mysterious or understood by few people, and 'parlance' refers to a particular way of speaking or using words, especially a way common to a particular group of people. Therefore, 'arcane parlance' could mean a mysterious or less understood way of referring to something. In the context of Mogadishu, it could refer to the local names 'Xamar' or 'Hamar'. However, this is an inference and not explicitly stated in the passage. To answer the final sub-question, \"Is Mogadishu referred to in arcane parlance?\", based on the information available, it can be said that Mogadishu is locally known as 'Xamar' or 'Hamar', which could be considered as 'arcane parlance' if these terms are less understood or known outside the local context. \nAction 3: Finish[\"Mogadishu, also known locally as 'Xamar' or 'Hamar', could be considered as being referred to in 'arcane parlance'.\"]\nObservation 3: Episode finished, reward = 0\n\n"}, {"steps": 6, "answer": "\"I'm sorry, but without more specific information about the 'Savages' film you're referring to, I can't definitively answer your question.

Once I have these details, I can compare them to see if \"House\" fits the definition of a sitcom in arcane parlance.\nAction 1: Search[\"House TV show\"]\nObservation 1: House (also called House, M.D.) is an American medical drama television series that originally ran on the Fox network for eight seasons, from November 16, 2004, to May 21, 2012. Its main character, Dr. Gregory House (Hugh Laurie), is an unconventional, misanthropic medical genius who, despite his dependence on pain medication, leads a team of diagnosticians at the fictional Princeton\u2013Plainsboro Teaching Hospital (PPTH) in New Jersey. The series' premise originated with Paul Attanasio, while David Shore, who is credited as creator, was primarily responsible for conceiving the title character.. House often clashes with his fellow physicians, including his own diagnostic team, because many of his hypotheses about patients' illnesses are based on subtle or controversial insights.\nThought 2: \"House\" is a medical drama, not a traditional sitcom.

The show often involves conflicts between House and his colleagues due to his unique and sometimes controversial insights into patients' illnesses.

Sitcoms can be contrasted with sketch comedy, where a troupe may use new characters in each sketch, and stand-up comedy, where a comedian tells jokes and stories to an audience. Sitcoms originated in radio, but today are found mostly on television as one of its dominant narrative forms.. A sitcom may be recorded in front of a studio audience, depending on the program's production format. The effect of a live studio audience can be imitated or enhanced by the use of a laugh track..\nThought 4: A sitcom, or situation comedy, is a genre of comedy that revolves around a fixed set of characters who carry over from episode to episode. It's different from sketch comedy, which uses new characters in each sketch, and stand-up comedy, which involves a comedian telling jokes and stories to an audience. Sitcoms can be recorded in front of a live studio audience and often use a laugh track. Given this definition, it doesn't seem like \"House\" fits the traditional definition of a sitcom, even in a less common or specialized context. It's a medical drama, not a comedy, and its narrative and character dynamics are quite different from those typically found in sitcoms.

I'll need to search for this information separately. \nAction 3: Search[\"end of the Cretaceous period\"]\nObservation 3: Could not find \"end of the Cretaceous period\". Similar: ['Sahonachelyidae', 'Marine reptile', 'Parikimys', 'Boltysh crater', 'Pterodactyloidea'].\nThought 4: The search for \"end of the Cretaceous period\" did not yield any direct results. However, the similar entities suggest that the end of the Cretaceous period might be related to events or species that existed during that time. I'll try a more general search for \"Cretaceous period\" again and look specifically for information about its end.\nAction 4: Search[\"Cretaceous period\"]\nObservation 4: The Cretaceous (IPA: /kr\u026a\u02c8te\u026a\u0283\u0259s/ krih-TAY-sh\u0259ss)[2] is a geological period that lasted from about 145 to 66 million years ago (Mya). It is the third and final period of the Mesozoic Era, as well as the longest. At around 79 million years, it is the longest geological period of the entire Phanerozoic. The name is derived from the Latin creta, \"chalk\", which is abundant in the latter half of the period. It is usually abbreviated K, for its German translation Kreide..\nThought 5: The information about the end of the Cretaceous period is not directly available in the observed text. However, it is known that the Cretaceous period ended about 66 million years ago. This marked the end of the Mesozoic Era. Now, I need to address the third sub-question: \"What does 'arcane parlance' mean in this context?\". Arcane parlance refers to a manner of speaking that is old or mysterious. In this context, it could mean that the statement about the end of the Cretaceous period is being made in a manner that is not commonly used or understood. \nThought 6: The final sub-question is \"Is the claim being made in an old or mysterious manner of speaking?\". This is subjective and depends on the interpretation of the statement. However, given that the term 'arcane parlance' is used, it can be inferred that the claim is indeed being made in a manner that is not commonly used or understood. \nAction 5: Finish[\"Yes, the Cretaceous period did end around 66 million years ago, marking the end of the Mesozoic Era.

Following his rescue and return home, Brody is hailed as a war hero and promoted to Gunnery Sergeant. However, a CIA officer, Carrie Mathison, suspects that Brody was turned by al-Qaeda, and tries to stop him from potentially committing a terrorist act.

I will start by searching for Charles Manson to understand who he is and what crimes he was accused of. Then, I will look for information about any legal proceedings that may have proven his innocence. Finally, I will try to find out his current legal status. \nAction 1: Search[Charles Manson]\nObservation 1: Charles Milles Manson (n\u00e9\u00a0Maddox; November 12, 1934 \u2013 November 19, 2017) was an American criminal, cult leader and musician who led the Manson Family, a cult based in California, in the late 1960s. Some of the members committed a series of at least nine murders at four locations in July and August 1969. In 1971, Manson was convicted of first-degree murder and conspiracy to commit murder for the deaths of seven people, including the film actress Sharon Tate. The prosecution contended that, while Manson never directly ordered the murders, his ideology constituted an overt act of conspiracy.[1]. Before the murders, Manson had spent more than half of his life in correctional institutions.\nThought 2: Charles Manson was a criminal and cult leader who led the Manson Family in the late 1960s. Some members of this cult committed a series of murders, and Manson was convicted of first-degree murder and conspiracy to commit murder for the deaths of seven people. The prosecution argued that Manson's ideology constituted an overt act of conspiracy, even though he never directly ordered the murders. This information suggests that Manson was indeed guilty of serious crimes. However, I still need to find out if there have been any legal proceedings that proved his innocence. \nAction 2: Lookup[innocence]\nObservation 2: (Result 1 / 1) She had been visiting him in prison for at least nine years and maintained several websites that proclaimed his innocence.[149] The wedding license expired on February 5, 2015, without a marriage ceremony taking place.[150] Journalist Daniel Simone reported that the wedding was canceled after Manson discovered that Burton wanted to marry him only so that she and friend Craig Hammond could use his corpse as a tourist attraction after his death.[150][151] According to Simone, Manson believed that he would never die and may simply have used the possibility of marriage as a way to encourage Burton and Hammond to continue visiting him and bringing him gifts.\nThought 3: The information found mentions a woman who visited Manson in prison and maintained websites proclaiming his innocence. However, this does not provide any legal evidence or proceedings that would prove Manson's innocence. It seems to be more of a personal belief rather than a legal fact. I still need to find out if there have been any official legal proceedings that cleared Manson of his crimes. \nAction 3: Lookup[legal proceedings]\nObservation 3: No more results.\n\nThought 4: There are no more results regarding any legal proceedings that could have proven Charles Manson's innocence. This suggests that there were no such proceedings. However, to be sure, I should check the current legal status of Charles Manson. Since Manson passed away in 2017, if he had been proven innocent, it would have had to happen before his death. \nAction 4: Lookup[legal status]\nObservation 4: No more results.\n\nThought 5: There are no more results regarding the legal status of Charles Manson. Given the information I have found, it appears that Manson was convicted of his crimes and remained so until his death in 2017. There is no evidence of any legal proceedings that proved his innocence. Therefore, it seems safe to conclude that Charles Manson was not proven innocent of all crimes he was accused of. \nAction 5: Finish[Charles Manson was not proven innocent of all crimes he was accused of.]\nObservation 5: Episode finished, reward = 0\n\n"}, {"steps": 2, "answer": "No, it is not true that Sean Penn has only ever acted on stage.

This will help me determine the likelihood of her involvement in the 2015 NBA Finals. \nAction 1: Search[Annette Badland]\nObservation 1: Annette Badland (born 26 August 1950) is an English actress known for a wide range of roles on television, radio, stage, and film. She is best known for her roles as Charlotte in the BBC crime drama series Bergerac, Margaret Blaine in the BBC science fiction series Doctor Who, Mrs Glenna Fitzgibbons in the first season of Outlander, Babe Smith in the BBC soap opera EastEnders, and as Dr Fleur Perkins on the ITV mystery series Midsomer Murders. She was nominated for the Laurence Olivier Award for Best Actress in a Supporting Role in 1993 for her performance as Sadie in Jim Cartwright's play The Rise and Fall of Little Voice; a role she reprised in the 1998 film adaptation Little Voice.[1]. Badland was born on 26 August 1950 in Edgbaston, Birmingham. Her mother, originally from Loanhead, Scotland, relocated to Birmingham during World War II to work as a munitions and aircraft worker in the factories, where she met Badland's father.[2] Her family often returned to Scotland for holidays and to visit family, or sometimes they holidayed in Wales.[3][2] Badland trained in acting at East 15 Acting School in Loughton, Essex, working in \"rep\" at Southwold Summer Theatre during her time there.\nThought 2: Annette Badland is an English actress known for her roles in television, radio, stage, and film. There is no mention of her being involved in sports, let alone the NBA. However, to be thorough, I should also gather information about the 2015 NBA Finals to see if there's any mention of her. \nAction 2: Search[2015 NBA Finals]\nObservation 2: The 2015 NBA Finals was the championship series of the National Basketball Association's (NBA) 2014\u201315 season and the conclusion of the season's playoffs played from June 4 to 16, 2015. It was contested by the Western Conference champion Golden State Warriors and the Eastern Conference champion Cleveland Cavaliers.. The Warriors, led by the duo of Klay Thompson and 2014\u201315 MVP Stephen Curry, won the opening game at home in overtime. However, despite the loss of an injured Kevin Love and Kyrie Irving during most of the series, the Cavaliers, led by LeBron James (in his fifth consecutive Finals appearance, and sixth overall[1]) managed to take a 2\u20131 series lead before the Warriors won the last three for their first title since 1975.. Golden State's Andre Iguodala was named NBA Finals Most Valuable Player (MVP).\nThought 3: The 2015 NBA Finals was a basketball event contested by the Golden State Warriors and the Cleveland Cavaliers. There is no mention of Annette Badland in the context of this event. Given that she is an actress and not known for any involvement in sports, it is highly unlikely that she was present or participated in the 2015 NBA Finals. \nAction 3: Finish[No, Annette Badland did not participate or was present in the 2015 NBA Finals.]\nObservation 3: Episode finished, reward = 0\n\n"}, {"steps": 3, "answer": "Waiting for user input.", "gt_answer": "SUPPORTS", "question_idx": 22, "em": 0, "reward": 0, "f1": 0, "n_calls": 6, "n_badcalls": 3, "traj": "Solve a question answering task with interleaving Thought, Action, Observation steps.

The best way to do this would be to search for Ann Richards on Wikipedia, which should provide a summary of her professional career. If she was involved in politics, it should be mentioned there. \nAction 1: Search[Ann Richards]\nObservation 1: Dorothy Ann Richards (n\u00e9e Willis; September 1, 1933 \u2013 September 13, 2006) was an American politician who served as the 45th governor of Texas from 1991 to 1995. A Democrat, she first came to national attention as the Texas State Treasurer, when she gave the keynote address at the 1988 Democratic National Convention. Richards was the second female governor of Texas (the first being Miriam A. Ferguson), and was frequently noted in the media for her outspoken feminism and her one-liners.[1]. Born in McLennan County, Texas, Richards became a schoolteacher after graduating from Baylor University.\nThought 2: The Wikipedia entry for Ann Richards confirms that she was indeed professionally involved in politics. She served as the 45th governor of Texas and was a Democrat. She also held the position of Texas State Treasurer and gave the keynote address at the 1988 Democratic National Convention. This information answers the question about Ann Richards' professional involvement in politics.\nAction 2: Finish[Ann Richards was professionally involved in politics, serving as the 45th governor of Texas and as the Texas State Treasurer.]\nObservation 2: Episode finished, reward = 0\n\n"}, {"steps": 5, "answer": "\"Yes, Drake Bell has released an EP.\"", "gt_answer": "SUPPORTS", "question_idx": 24, "em": 0, "reward": 0, "f1": 0, "n_calls": 6, "n_badcalls": 1, "traj": "Solve a question answering task with interleaving Thought, Action, Observation steps.

To do this, I will first need to verify who Drake Bell is and confirm that he is indeed a musician. Then, I will need to find out if he has released any music, specifically in the form of an EP. I will start by searching for Drake Bell on Wikipedia.\nAction 1: Search[\"Drake Bell\"]\nObservation 1: Jared Drake Bell[4] (born June 27, 1986) is an American actor and musician.[5][6] Born in Newport Beach, California, he began his career as a child actor in the 1990s, appearing on Home Improvement (1994) and in several commercials. He rose to prominence with Nickelodeon, playing starring roles in the sketch comedy series The Amanda Show (1999\u20132002), the sitcom Drake & Josh (2004\u20132007), and the Nickelodeon television film series The Fairly OddParents (2011\u20132014). He also voiced Peter Parker / Spider-Man on the Disney XD series Ultimate Spider-Man (2012\u20132017) and various Disney XD media. He has won ten Kids' Choice Awards, a Teen Choice Award, and a Young Artist Award, among other accolades.. Bell began his musical career contributing to the soundtrack of Drake & Josh.\nThought 2: The Wikipedia entry confirms that Drake Bell is indeed a musician, as well as an actor. He began his musical career contributing to the soundtrack of Drake & Josh. Now, I need to find out if he has released any music, specifically an EP. I will continue to look up more information in his Wikipedia entry.\nAction 2: Lookup[\"EP\"]\nObservation 2: No more results.\n\nThought 3: The keyword \"EP\" did not yield any results in the current passage. This could mean that Drake Bell has not released an EP, or it could simply mean that the information is not included in the current passage. I should try a broader search term, such as \"music\", to see if there is any mention of his musical releases.\nAction 3: Lookup[\"music\"]\nObservation 3: No more results.\n\nThought 4: The keyword \"music\" also did not yield any results in the current passage. This is surprising, given that Drake Bell is confirmed to be a musician. It's possible that the details of his musical career are not included in the first paragraph of his Wikipedia page. I should try searching for \"Drake Bell discography\" to find more specific information about his musical releases.\nAction 4: Search[\"Drake Bell discography\"]\nObservation 4: American singer-songwriter Drake Bell has released six studio albums, three extended plays, one video album, eighteen singles (including two as a featured artist), five promotional singles, twelve music videos and other album appearances.. On September 27, 2005, Bell released his debut album Telegraph. The album includes 12 tracks. His song, \"Found a Way\"\u2014featured as the theme song for Drake & Josh\u2014is also included on the show's soundtrack. In 2006, Bell signed with Universal Motown.\nThought 5: The discography of Drake Bell confirms that he has released three extended plays, which are commonly referred to as EPs.

Her career spanned over five decades. Raised in Stockton, California, by working-class parents, Leigh was discovered at 18 by actress Norma Shearer, who helped her secure a contract with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer.. Leigh appeared in radio programs before her first formal foray into acting, making her film debut in the drama The Romance of Rosy Ridge (1947). With MGM, she appeared in many films which spanned a wide variety of genres, which include the crime-drama Act of Violence (1948), the drama Little Women (1949), the comedy Angels in the Outfield (1951), the romance Scaramouche (1952) and the western drama The Naked Spur (1953).\nThought 2: Janet Leigh was a well-known American actress with a career spanning over five decades.

The Bermuda Triangle, also known as the Devil's Triangle, is an urban legend focused on a loosely defined region in the western part of the North Atlantic Ocean where a number of aircraft and ships are said to have disappeared under mysterious circumstances. The idea of the area as uniquely prone to disappearances arose in the mid-20th century, but most reputable sources dismiss the idea that there is any mystery.[1][2][3]. The earliest suggestion of unusual disappearances in the Bermuda area appeared in an article written by Edward Van Winkle Jones of the Miami Herald that was distributed by the Associated Press and appeared in various American newspapers on 17 September 1950.[4][5][6]. Two years later, Fate magazine published \"Sea Mystery at Our Back Door\", a short article by George X.\nThought 2: The Bermuda Triangle is located in the western part of the North Atlantic Ocean, not the Himalayas.

Advertising aims to put a product or service in the spotlight in hopes of drawing it attention from consumers.

Commercial advertisements often seek to generate increased consumption of their products or services through \"branding\", which associates a product name or image with certain qualities in the minds of consumers.

By the end of 2006, the company had won 149 contracts worth around $10.5 million.[1] In early 2007, AEY secured a nearly $300 million U.S. government contract to supply the Afghan Army with 100 million rounds of AK-47 ammunition, millions of rounds for SVD Dragunov sniper rifles, aviation rockets and other munitions.[2][3] The ammunition that AEY had secured in Albania to fulfill the contract had originally come from China, violating the terms of AEY's contract with the US Army, which bans Chinese ammunition. Packouz  was aware that the products were prohibited and would not be accepted, and was instrumental in the covering up of the origins of the ammunition.[4][5].\nThought 2: David Packouz is an American arms dealer, musician, and inventor. He was involved in a significant arms dealing company, AEY Inc., which won numerous contracts.

I will start by searching for James VI and I to understand his role and influence. \nAction 1: Search[James VI and I]\nObservation 1: James VI and I (James Charles Stuart; 19 June 1566 \u2013 27 March 1625) was King of Scotland as James VI from 24 July 1567 and King of England and Ireland as James I from the union of the Scottish and English crowns on 24\u00a0March 1603 until his death in 1625. Although he long tried to get both countries to adopt a closer political union, the kingdoms of Scotland and England remained sovereign states, with their own parliaments, judiciaries, and laws, ruled by James in personal union. He was the longest-reigning monarch of the Kingdom of Scotland.. James was the son of Mary, Queen of Scots, and a great-great-grandson of Henry VII, King of England and Lord of Ireland, and thus a potential successor to all three thrones. He acceded to the Scottish throne at the age of thirteen months, after his mother was forced to abdicate in his favour.\nThought 2: From the information gathered, it's clear that James VI and I was a king who ruled both Scotland and England. He tried to bring the two countries into a closer political union, but they remained sovereign states with their own parliaments, judiciaries, and laws. This suggests that he may have been an advocate for a single parliament, but I need more specific information to confirm this. I will now search for the historical context of a single parliament for Scotland and England.\nAction 2: Search[single parliament Scotland England]\nObservation 2: Could not find single parliament Scotland England.

However, the 'Acts of Union 1707' seems relevant as it might provide context on the political union of the two countries. I'll search for that next.\nAction 3: Search[Acts of Union 1707]\nObservation 3: The Acts of Union were two Acts of Parliament: the Union with Scotland Act 1706 passed by the Parliament of England, and the Union with Scotland Act 1707 passed by the Parliament of Scotland. They put into effect the terms of the Treaty of Union that had been agreed on 22 July 1706, following negotiation between commissioners representing the parliaments of the two countries. By the two Acts, the Kingdom of England and the Kingdom of Scotland\u2014which at the time were separate states with separate legislatures, but with the same monarch\u2014were, in the words of the Treaty, \"united into One Kingdom by the Name of Great Britain\".\nThought 4: The Acts of Union in 1707 united the Kingdom of England and the Kingdom of Scotland into one kingdom, Great Britain. This happened after James VI and I's reign, but it does show that the idea of a single parliament was eventually realized. However, I still need to find direct evidence of James VI and I advocating for a single parliament. I'll look up 'parliament' in the passage about James VI and I.\nAction 4: Lookup[parliament]\nObservation 4: Although he long tried to get both countries to adopt a closer political union, the kingdoms of Scotland and England remained sovereign states, with their own parliaments, judiciaries, and laws, ruled by James in personal union.\nThought 5: The information reaffirms that James VI and I tried to bring Scotland and England into a closer political union, but they remained separate states with their own parliaments during his reign. This suggests that he was indeed an advocate for a single parliament, even if his efforts were not successful during his lifetime. I believe I have enough information to answer the question now.\nAction 5: Finish[Yes, James VI and I was a major advocate for a single parliament for Scotland and England.

The specifics of what constitutes an action film has been in scholarly debate since the 1980s. While some scholars such as David Bordwell suggested they were films that favor spectacle to storytelling, others such as Goeff King stated they allow the scenes of spectacle to be attuned to story telling. Action films are often hybrid with other genres, mixing into various forms ranging to comedies, science fiction films, and horror films.. While the term \"action film\" or \"action adventure film\" has been used as early as the 1910s, the contemporary definition usually refers to a film that came with the arrival of New Hollywood and the rise of antiheros appearing in American films of the late 1960s and 1970s drawing from war films, crime films and Westerns.\nThought 3: Action films predominantly feature chase sequences, fights, shootouts, explosions, and stunt work.

It could be a movie, a music album, or a band. I should search for 'Billboard Dad' to get more information.\nAction 1: Search[\"Billboard Dad\"]\nObservation 1: Billboard Dad is a 1998 American romantic comedy film directed by Alan Metter starring Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen. It was produced by Warner Bros. in collaboration with Dualstar Productions and Tapestry Films (now Screendoor).. Set in Los Angeles, California, the film revolves around 12-year-old twin sisters, Emily (a surfer girl) and Tess (a member of the high-diving team), as they try various strategies to get their widower father, Max (a talented artist and sculptor), a girlfriend.. After their first attempts end in failure, Tess and Emily team up with their friend, Cody, to paint an advertisement on a giant billboard situated high above Sunset Boulevard.\nThought 2: 'Billboard Dad' is a movie, not a music genre.

It's unlikely that 'Billboard Dad' is a genre of music, even in arcane parlance. However, to be sure, I should look up the definition of a music genre to confirm that a movie title doesn't fit the criteria.\nAction 3: Search[\"Music genre\"]\nObservation 3: A music genre is a conventional category that identifies some pieces of music as belonging to a shared tradition or set of conventions.[1] Genre is to be distinguished from musical form and musical style, although in practice these terms are sometimes used interchangeably.[2]. Music can be divided into genres in numerous ways, sometimes broadly and with polarity, such as for popular music, as opposed to art music or folk music; or, as another example, religious music and secular music. The artistic nature of music means that these classifications are often subjective and controversial, and some genres may overlap. As genres evolve, sometimes new music is lumped into existing categories or else a proliferation of derivative subgenres, fusion genres and \"micro genres\" starts to accrue.. Douglass M.\nThought 4: A music genre is a category that identifies music as part of a shared tradition or conventions. It's clear that 'Billboard Dad', being a movie, doesn't fit into this definition. It's not a shared tradition or set of conventions in music. Therefore, 'Billboard Dad' is not a genre of music, even in arcane parlance.\nAction 4: Finish[\"No, 'Billboard Dad' is not a genre of music, even in arcane parlance.

It seems that I'm unable to find the specific information about the cast of 'Men in Black II' on Wikipedia. I might need to use a different source to find this information. However, based on my general knowledge about the movie, it's unlikely that it features eight children in its main cast.

It was originally published in two parts, in 1605 and 1615. Considered a founding work of Western literature, it is often labelled as the first modern novel[2][3] and the greatest work ever written.[4][5] Don Quixote is also one of the most-translated books in the world[6] and one of the best-selling novels of all time.. The plot revolves around the adventures of a member of the lowest nobility, a hidalgo[d] from La Mancha named Alonso Quijano, who reads so many chivalric romances that he loses his mind and decides to become a knight-errant (caballero andante) to revive chivalry and serve his nation, under the name Don Quixote de la Mancha.[b] He recruits as his squire a simple farm labourer, Sancho Panza, who brings a unique, earthy wit to Don Quixote's lofty rhetoric. In the first part of the book, Don Quixote does not see the world for what it is and prefers to imagine that he is living out a knightly story meant for the annals of all time.\nThought 2: The passage mentions that Don Quixote recruits a simple farm labourer, Sancho Panza, as his squire.

Jameson started acting in erotic videos in 1993 after having worked as a stripper and glamour model. By 1996, she had won the \"Top Newcomer\" award from each of the three major adult movie organizations. She has since won more than 35 adult-video awards, and has been inducted into the X-Rated Critics Organization (XRCO) and Adult Video News (AVN) Halls of Fame.[9][10]. Jameson founded the adult-entertainment company ClubJenna in 2000 with Jay Grdina, whom she later married and divorced.\nThought 2: The Wikipedia entry confirms that Jenna Jameson worked as a stripper and a glamour model before she started acting in erotic videos in 1993. Now, I need to find information about the specific language or jargon associated with these professions. However, this might be challenging as such information is not typically included in a Wikipedia biography.

In 1976, he co-founded Apple Computer with his early business partner Steve Jobs. Through his work at Apple in the 1970s and 1980s, he is widely recognized as one of the most prominent pioneers of the personal computer revolution.[4]. In 1975, Wozniak started developing the Apple\u00a0I[5]:\u200a150\u200a into the computer that launched Apple when he and Jobs first began marketing it the following year. He was the primary designer of the Apple II, introduced in 1977, known as one of the first highly successful mass-produced microcomputers,[6] while Jobs oversaw the development of its foam-molded plastic case and early Apple employee Rod Holt developed its switching power supply.[7] With human\u2013computer interface expert Jef Raskin, Wozniak had a major influence over the initial development of the original  Macintosh concepts from 1979 to 1981, when Jobs took over the project following Wozniak's brief departure from the company due to a traumatic airplane accident.[8][3] After permanently leaving Apple in 1985, Wozniak founded CL 9 and created the first programmable universal remote, released in 1987.\nThought 2: From the information gathered, Steve Wozniak was born on August 11, 1950.

Such an institution can also be known as a school of music, music academy, music faculty, college of music, music department (of a larger institution), conservatory, conservatorium or conservatoire (/k\u0259n\u02c8s\u025c\u02d0rv\u0259tw\u0251\u02d0r/ k\u0259n-SER-v\u0259-twar, French: [k\u0254\u0303s\u025b\u0281vatwa\u0281]). Instruction consists of training in the performance of musical instruments, singing, musical composition, conducting, musicianship, as well as academic and research fields such as musicology, music history and music theory.. Music instruction can be provided within the compulsory general education system, or within specialized children's music schools such as the Purcell School. Elementary-school children can access music instruction also in after-school institutions such as music academies or music schools.\nThought 3: A music school, as per the information from Wikipedia, is an institution specialized in the study, training, and research of music. It provides instruction in various aspects of music, including performance of musical instruments, singing, musical composition, conducting, musicianship, as well as academic and research fields such as musicology, music history and music theory. Comparing this to the information about Island Records, it's clear that Island Records does not fit the description of a music school.

It stretches from central and eastern Afghanistan[2][3] into northwestern Pakistan and far southeastern Tajikistan. The range forms the western section of the Hindu Kush Himalayan Region (HKH);[4][5][6] to the north, near its northeastern end, the Hindu Kush buttresses the Pamir Mountains near the point where the borders of Afghanistan, China, and Pakistan meet, after which it runs southwest through Pakistan and into Afghanistan near their border.[2]. The eastern end of the Hindu Kush in the north merges with the Karakoram Range.[7][8] Towards its southern end, it connects with the White Mountains near the Kabul River.[9][10] It divides the valley of the Amu Darya (the ancient Oxus) to the north from the Indus River valley to the south. The range has numerous high snow-capped peaks, with the highest point being Tirich Mir or Terichmir at 7,708 metres (25,289\u00a0ft) in the Chitral District of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan..\nThought 2: The highest point of the Hindu Kush is Tirich Mir or Terichmir, which is located in Pakistan. This mountain is not Everest, so Everest is not the highest point of the Hindu Kush. However, to fully answer the question, I need to confirm whether Everest is part of the Hindu Kush range or not. \nAction 2: Search[\"Everest\"]\nObservation 2: Mount Everest[3] is Earth's highest mountain above sea level, located in the Mahalangur Himal sub-range of the Himalayas. The China\u2013Nepal border runs across its summit point.[4] Its elevation (snow height) of 8,848.86\u00a0m (29,031\u00a0ft 8+1\u20442\u00a0in) was most recently established in 2020 by the Chinese and Nepali authorities.[5][6]. Mount Everest attracts many climbers, including highly experienced mountaineers. There are two main climbing routes, one approaching the summit from the southeast in Nepal (known as the \"standard route\") and the other from the north in Tibet. While not posing substantial technical climbing challenges on the standard route, Everest presents dangers such as altitude sickness, weather, and wind, as well as hazards from avalanches and the Khumbu Icefall.\nThought 3: Mount Everest is located in the Mahalangur Himal sub-range of the Himalayas, which is different from the Hindu Kush. Therefore, Everest is not part of the Hindu Kush range. Now I can answer the question.\nAction 3: Finish[\"No, Everest is not the highest point of the Hindu Kush.

This can be done by searching for the song \"Same Old Love\" on Wikipedia. If the song is by Selena Gomez, it will likely mention her in the first paragraph. If not, it may suggest similar entities to search.\nAction 1: Search[\"Same Old Love\"]\nObservation 1: \"Same Old Love\" is a song recorded by American singer Selena Gomez, who included it on and released it from her second studio album Revival (2015). The song was written by Charli XCX, Ross Golan, and its producers Stargate and Benny Blanco. The song was released as the second single from Revival on September 10, 2015, to contemporary hit radio. It was initially composed by XCX with Stargate and later recorded by Gomez without the former in the studio at the time. \"Same Old Love\" is a midtempo electropop and synth-pop song backed by a wonky piano loop, a finger-click beat and Italo disco synths.\nThought 2: The observation confirms that \"Same Old Love\" is indeed a song by Selena Gomez. It was included in her second studio album, Revival, and was released as a single in 2015. This information contradicts the idea that the song is disassociated from Selena Gomez. However, to be thorough, I should also check if there have been any instances where Selena Gomez has publicly disassociated herself from the song.

This further supports the connection between Selena Gomez and the song. There is still no evidence to suggest that she has disassociated herself from \"Same Old Love\".

I'll start by looking up the typical resting heart rate. \nAction 1: Search[\"Resting heart rate\"]\nObservation 1: Heart rate is the frequency of the heartbeat measured by the number of contractions of the heart per minute (beats per minute, or bpm). The heart rate varies according to the body's physical needs, including the need to absorb oxygen and excrete carbon dioxide. It is also modulated by numerous factors, including (but not limited to) genetics, physical fitness, stress or psychological status, diet, drugs, hormonal status, environment, and disease/illness, as well as the interaction between these factors.[1] It is usually equal or close to the pulse rate measured at any peripheral point.[2]. The American Heart Association states the normal resting adult human heart rate is 60\u2013100 bpm. An ultra-trained athlete would have a resting heart rate of 37\u201338 bpm.[3] Tachycardia is a high heart rate, defined as above 100 bpm at rest.[4] Bradycardia is a low heart rate, defined as below 60 bpm at rest.\nThought 2: The typical resting heart rate for an adult is between 60 and 100 beats per minute, according to the American Heart Association. An ultra-trained athlete might have a resting heart rate as low as 37-38 bpm. Therefore, a resting heart rate of 22 beats per minute is significantly lower than the normal range.

In 1968, three of the genre's most famous pioneers \u2013 British bands Led Zeppelin, Black Sabbath and Deep Purple \u2013 were founded.[3] Though they came to attract wide audiences, they were often derided by critics. Several American bands modified heavy metal into more accessible forms during the 1970s: the raw, sleazy sound and shock rock of Alice Cooper and Kiss; the blues-rooted rock of Aerosmith; and the flashy guitar leads and party rock of Van Halen.[4] During the mid-1970s, Judas Priest helped spur the genre's evolution by discarding much of its blues influence,[5][6] while Mot\u00f6rhead introduced a punk rock sensibility and an increasing emphasis on speed. Beginning in the late 1970s, bands in the new wave of British heavy metal such as Iron Maiden and Saxon followed in a similar vein. By the end of the decade, heavy metal fans became known as \"metalheads\" or \"headbangers\".\nThought 2: The information from Wikipedia confirms that Heavy Metal music developed in the late 1960s and early 1970s, largely in the United Kingdom and United States. This aligns with the claim that Heavy Metal music was developed in the early 1970s. However, it also suggests that the development started in the late 1960s.

It could be a band, a software, or something else. Once I have this information, I can then verify if this 'Tool' has won three Oscars. The term 'arcane parlance' seems to be a separate query about its meaning or relevance, which I can look up separately. Let's start by identifying 'Tool'. \nAction 1: Search[Tool]\nObservation 1: A tool is an object that can extend an individual's ability to modify features of the surrounding environment or help them accomplish a particular task. Although many animals use simple tools, only human beings, whose use of stone tools dates back hundreds of millennia, have been observed using tools to make other tools.. Early human tools, made of such materials as stone, bone, and wood, were used for the preparation of food, hunting, the manufacture of weapons, and the working of materials to produce clothing and useful artifacts and crafts such as pottery, along with the construction of housing, businesses, infrastructure, and transportation. The development of metalworking made additional types of tools possible. Harnessing energy sources, such as animal power, wind, or steam, allowed increasingly complex tools to produce an even larger range of items, with the Industrial Revolution marking an inflection point in the use of tools.\nThought 2: The search result for 'Tool' seems to refer to the general concept of a tool as an object used to perform tasks. However, in the context of winning Oscars, this doesn't seem to fit. It's more likely that 'Tool' refers to a specific entity, possibly a band or a film. I should try searching for 'Tool' in a more specific context, such as 'Tool band' or 'Tool film'.\nAction 2: Search[Tool band]\nObservation 2: Tool is an American rock band from Los Angeles. Formed in 1990, the group consists of vocalist Maynard James Keenan, guitarist Adam Jones, drummer Danny Carey and bassist Justin Chancellor, who replaced founding member Paul D'Amour in 1995. Tool has won four Grammy Awards,[1] performed worldwide tours, and produced albums topping the charts in several countries.. To date, the band has released five studio albums, one EP and one box set. It emerged with a heavy metal sound on their first studio album, Undertow (1993), and became a dominant act in the alternative metal movement with the release of their follow-up album \u00c6nima in 1996.\nThought 3: The 'Tool' in question is indeed a band. However, the band has won Grammy Awards, not Oscars. This suggests that the initial claim may be incorrect. However, to be thorough, I should also check if there's a film named 'Tool' that could have won Oscars. As for 'arcane parlance', it's a term that refers to obscure or specialized language. It doesn't seem to have a direct connection to the band Tool or the Oscars, but I'll look it up to be sure.\nAction 3: Search[Tool film]\nObservation 3: Could not find Tool film. Similar: ['Tool (band)', 'Tool discography', 'L.A. Tool & Die', 'Recruitment tool', 'Tool use by non-humans'].\nThought 4: There doesn't seem to be a film named 'Tool' that could have won Oscars. This confirms that the initial claim is likely incorrect. Now, I'll look up 'arcane parlance' to clarify its meaning and relevance in this context.\nAction 4: Search[arcane parlance]\nObservation 4: Could not find arcane parlance. Similar: ['Bakunawa', 'Bektashi Order'].\nThought 5: The term 'arcane parlance' doesn't seem to have a specific entry or similar terms in the search results. It's a general term that refers to obscure or specialized language. It doesn't seem to have a direct connection to the band Tool or the Oscars. Given the information I have, I can now answer the initial queries. 'Tool' in this context refers to a band that has won Grammy Awards, not Oscars. The term 'arcane parlance' refers to obscure or specialized language, but its relevance in this context is unclear. \nAction 5: Finish[The band 'Tool' has won Grammy Awards, not Oscars.
