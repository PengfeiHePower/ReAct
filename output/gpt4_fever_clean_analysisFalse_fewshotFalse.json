It was most active and achieved its greatest commercial success during the 1990s, dealing largely in the field of urban music. It was originally distributed by its co-creator Arista Records from 1989 through 2001, after which it was shuttered and absorbed into Arista. In 2004, the label was rebooted, and it began operating through Jive Records until both were absorbed into RCA Records in 2011. Today, the label's back catalog and reissues are managed by Legacy Recordings..\nThought 5: The information about LaFace Records does not provide any details about L.A. Reid's tenure as CEO of Arista Records. It seems that I am unable to find specific information about the duration of his time at Arista Records. I may need to conclude that the duration of L.A.

Wilk started his career as a drummer for Greta in 1990, and helped co-found Rage Against the Machine with Tom Morello and Zack de la Rocha in August 1991. Following that band's breakup in October 2000, Wilk, Morello, Rage Against the Machine bassist Tim Commerford and Soundgarden frontman Chris Cornell formed the supergroup Audioslave, which broke up in 2007. From 2016 to 2019, he played in the band Prophets of Rage, with Commerford, Morello, Chuck D, B-Real and DJ Lord.\nThought 2: The information from the search shows that Brad Wilk did co-found Rage Against the Machine, but not in 1962.

She was nominated for the Laurence Olivier Award for Best Actress in a Supporting Role in 1993 for her performance as Sadie in Jim Cartwright's play The Rise and Fall of Little Voice; a role she reprised in the 1998 film adaptation Little Voice.[1]. Badland was born on 26 August 1950 in Edgbaston, Birmingham. Her mother, originally from Loanhead, Scotland, relocated to Birmingham during World War II to work as a munitions and aircraft worker in the factories, where she met Badland's father.[2] Her family often returned to Scotland for holidays and to visit family, or sometimes they holidayed in Wales.[3][2] Badland trained in acting at East 15 Acting School in Loughton, Essex, working in \"rep\" at Southwold Summer Theatre during her time there.\nThought 2: The information about Annette Badland does not mention any involvement in the NBA or the 2015 NBA Finals.

It was contested by the Western Conference champion Golden State Warriors and the Eastern Conference champion Cleveland Cavaliers.. The Warriors, led by the duo of Klay Thompson and 2014\u201315 MVP Stephen Curry, won the opening game at home in overtime. However, despite the loss of an injured Kevin Love and Kyrie Irving during most of the series, the Cavaliers, led by LeBron James (in his fifth consecutive Finals appearance, and sixth overall[1]) managed to take a 2\u20131 series lead before the Warriors won the last three for their first title since 1975.. Golden State's Andre Iguodala was named NBA Finals Most Valuable Player (MVP).\nThought 3: The information about the 2015 NBA Finals does not mention Annette Badland either.

However, there's no mention of Colin Kaepernick becoming a starter in this paragraph. I need to find more information about Kaepernick's role in this season. Action 4: Lookup[Colin Kaepernick]\nAction 4: Lookup[Colin Kaepernick]\nObservation 4: (Result 1 / 5) Quarterback Alex Smith missed two starts mid-season after suffering a concussion, and backup Colin Kaepernick successfully filled in.\nThought 5: This information confirms that Colin Kaepernick became a starter during the 49ers' 63rd season in the NFL, which was in 2012. He filled in for the injured Alex Smith. However, the claim also mentioned the Republican Party, which is unrelated to Kaepernick's football career. I can now conclude that while the part about Kaepernick becoming a starter during the 49ers' 63rd season is true, the mention of the Republican Party is incorrect. Action 5: Finish[Partially true.

However, \"The Master of Nothing\" is not a common nickname for a director, so it might be a misunderstanding or a misquote. The director of \"Marnie\" is Alfred Hitchcock, who is often referred to as \"The Master of Suspense\". I should confirm this by looking up \"Marnie\" and its director.

I should search for that to get information about the director. Action 2: Search[Marnie (film)]\nAction 2: Search[Marnie (film)]\nObservation 2: Marnie is a 1964 American psychological thriller film directed by Alfred Hitchcock from a screenplay by Jay Presson Allen, based on the 1961 novel of the same name by Winston Graham. The film stars Tippi Hedren and Sean Connery.. Marnie became a milestone for several reasons. It was the last time a \"Hitchcock blonde\" would have a central role in one of his films. It also marked the end of Hitchcock's collaborations with cinematographer Robert Burks, who died in 1968; editor George Tomasini, who died soon after Marnie's release; and composer Bernard Herrmann, who was fired during Hitchcock's next film, Torn Curtain (1966), when Hitchcock and Universal studio executives wanted a pop-and-jazz-influenced score for the film..\nThought 3: The film \"Marnie\" was indeed directed by Alfred Hitchcock, as I suspected. However, there's no mention of the nickname \"The Master of Nothing\". As I thought earlier, Hitchcock is often referred to as \"The Master of Suspense\", not \"The Master of Nothing\".

Action 3: Search[Alfred Hitchcock]\nAction 3: Search[Alfred Hitchcock]\nObservation 3: Sir Alfred Joseph Hitchcock KBE (13 August 1899\u00a0\u2013 29 April 1980) was an English film director. He is widely regarded as one of the most influential figures in the history of cinema.[1] In a career spanning six decades, he directed over 50 feature films,[a] many of which are still widely watched and studied today. Known as the \"Master of Suspense\", Hitchcock became as well known as any of his actors thanks to his many interviews, his cameo appearances in most of his films, and his hosting and producing the television anthology Alfred Hitchcock Presents (1955\u201365). His films garnered 46 Academy Award nominations, including six wins, although he never won the award for Best Director, despite five nominations.. Hitchcock initially trained as a technical clerk and copywriter before entering the film industry in 1919 as a title card designer.\nThought 4: The information about Alfred Hitchcock confirms that he is indeed known as the \"Master of Suspense\", not the \"Master of Nothing\". With this information, I can now confidently refute the original claim. Action 4: Finish[The claim is false.

However, this seems to be a subjective statement as advertising can be both personal and impersonal depending on the context. Personal advertising refers to targeted ads that are based on individual's preferences and behaviors, while impersonal advertising is more general and not tailored to specific individuals. To confirm this, I should look up the definition of advertising. Action 1: Search[Advertising]\nAction 1: Search[Advertising]\nObservation 1: Advertising is the practice and techniques employed to bring attention to a product or service. Advertising aims to put a product or service in the spotlight in hopes of drawing it attention from consumers. It is typically used to promote a specific good or service, but there are wide range of uses, the most common being the commercial advertisement.. Commercial advertisements often seek to generate increased consumption of their products or services through \"branding\", which associates a product name or image with certain qualities in the minds of consumers. On the other hand, ads that intend to elicit an immediate sale are known as direct-response advertising.\nThought 2: The observation confirms that advertising is a practice used to draw attention to a product or service, often with the goal of increasing consumption. It can be either general, aiming to associate a product with certain qualities in the minds of consumers, or direct-response, which seeks to elicit an immediate sale. However, it doesn't directly address the claim that advertising is a personal message. I should look for more information about personal advertising to provide a more comprehensive answer. Action 2: Search[Personal Advertising]\nAction 2: Search[Personal Advertising]\nObservation 2: Could not find Personal Advertising. Similar: ['Personal advertisement', 'Advertising', 'Online advertising', 'Advertising agency', 'Classified advertising'].\nThought 3: I couldn't find the exact term \"Personal Advertising\". However, \"Personal advertisement\" and \"Online advertising\" could potentially provide relevant information. Personal advertisement might refer to individuals advertising themselves or their services, while online advertising could include targeted or personalized ads. I'll start by looking up \"Personal advertisement\". Action 3: Search[Personal advertisement]\nAction 3: Search[Personal advertisement]\nObservation 3: A personal advertisement, sometimes called a contact ad, is a form of classified advertising in which a person seeks to find another person for friendship, romance, marriage, or sexual activity. In British English, it is commonly known as an advert in a lonely hearts column. In India, it is a dating ad or matrimonial ad.. The earliest personal ads were placed in newspapers among other classified ads, and typically had matrimony as the objective. As interest in personal ads grew, newspapers provided personals sections specifically for those ads.\nThought 4: The observation about personal advertisement doesn't align with the context of the claim. Personal advertisements are more about individuals seeking relationships rather than a form of targeted advertising. Now, I should look up \"Online advertising\" as it might include information about personalized or targeted advertising. Action 4: Search[Online advertising]\nAction 4: Search[Online advertising]\nObservation 4: Online advertising, also known as online marketing, Internet advertising, digital advertising or web advertising, is a form of marketing and advertising that uses the Internet to promote products and services to audiences and platform users.[1] Online advertising includes email marketing, search engine marketing (SEM), social media marketing, many types of display advertising (including web banner advertising), and mobile advertising. Advertisements are increasingly being delivered via automated software systems operating across multiple websites, media services and platforms, known as programmatic advertising.[2]. Like other advertising media, online advertising frequently involves a publisher, who integrates advertisements into its online content, and an advertiser, who provides the advertisements to be displayed on the publisher's content. Other potential participants include advertising agencies that help generate and place the ad copy, an ad server which technologically delivers the ad and tracks statistics, and advertising affiliates who do independent promotional work for the advertiser.. In 2016, Internet advertising revenues in the United States surpassed those of cable television and broadcast television.[3]:\u200a14\u200a In 2017, Internet advertising revenues in the United States totaled $83.0 billion, a 14% increase over the $72.50 billion in revenues in 2016.[4] And research estimates for 2019's online advertising spend put it at $125.2 billion in the United States, some $54.8 billion higher than the spend on television ($70.4 billion).[5].\nThought 5: The observation about online advertising provides some insight into how advertising can be personalized. It mentions that advertisements are increasingly being delivered via automated software systems across multiple platforms, which could potentially be used for targeted advertising based on individual's preferences and behaviors. However, it doesn't explicitly mention personal or targeted advertising. I should look for a sentence that directly addresses this aspect. Action 5: Lookup[targeted advertising]\nAction 5: Lookup[targeted advertising]\nObservation 5: (Result 1 / 2) As advertisers collect data across multiple external websites about a user's online activity, they can create a detailed profile of the user's interests to deliver even more targeted advertising.\nThought 6: The observation confirms that targeted advertising is a practice where advertisers collect data about a user's online activity to create a detailed profile of the user's interests. This allows them to deliver more personalized advertising. This supports the idea that advertising can be a personal message when it is targeted or personalized. However, it's important to note that not all advertising is personal, as there are also general advertisements that are not tailored to specific individuals. I can now provide a comprehensive answer to the claim. Action 6: Finish[Advertising can be a personal message when it is targeted or personalized based on a user's interests and online activity.

Although he long tried to get both countries to adopt a closer political union, the kingdoms of Scotland and England remained sovereign states, with their own parliaments, judiciaries, and laws, ruled by James in personal union. He was the longest-reigning monarch of the Kingdom of Scotland.. James was the son of Mary, Queen of Scots, and a great-great-grandson of Henry VII, King of England and Lord of Ireland, and thus a potential successor to all three thrones. He acceded to the Scottish throne at the age of thirteen months, after his mother was forced to abdicate in his favour.\nThought 2: The observation confirms that James VI and I did indeed advocate for a closer political union between Scotland and England.

However, to confirm my thoughts, I should look up more information about Indonesia and Papua. Action 1: Search[Indonesia]\nAction 1: Search[Indonesia]\nObservation 1: Indonesia,[b] officially the Republic of Indonesia,[c] is a country in Southeast Asia and Oceania between the Indian and Pacific oceans. It consists of over 17,000 islands, including Sumatra, Java, Sulawesi, and parts of Borneo and New Guinea. Indonesia is the world's largest archipelagic state and the 14th-largest country by area, at 1,904,569 square kilometres (735,358 square miles). With over 280 million people, Indonesia is the world's fourth-most-populous country and the most populous Muslim-majority country. Java, the world's most populous island, is home to more than half of the country's population..\nThought 2: The information about Indonesia confirms my initial thought. Indonesia is a large country consisting of over 17,000 islands, including parts of Borneo and New Guinea. Papua is not mentioned as the entirety of Indonesia, but rather as a part of it.

The province also shares maritime boundaries with Palau in the Pacific. Following the splitting off of twenty regencies to create the three new provinces of Central Papua, Highland Papua, and South Papua on 30 June 2022, the residual province is divided into eight regencies (kabupaten) and one city (kota), the latter being the provincial capital of Jayapura. The province has a large potential in natural resources, such as gold, nickel, petroleum, etc.[10] Papua, along with five other Papuan provinces,[citation needed] has a higher degree of autonomy level compared to other Indonesian provinces.[11].\nThought 4: The information about Papua (province) confirms that it is indeed a part of Indonesia, not the entirety of it. It is a province located on the northern coast of Western New Guinea and shares borders with other provinces and the sovereign state of Papua New Guinea.

Hedda Gabler is a play by Henrik Ibsen, and the Battle of Hastings is a historical event that took place in 1066. It's unlikely that a play's premiere took place at a historical battle.

The world premiere was staged on 31 January 1891 at the Residenztheater in Munich. Ibsen himself was in attendance, although he remained back-stage.[1] The play has been canonized as a masterpiece within the genres of literary realism, nineteenth century theatre, and world drama.[2][3][4]  Ibsen mainly wrote realistic plays until his forays into modern drama. Hedda Gabler dramatizes the experiences of the title character, Hedda, the daughter of a general, who is trapped in a marriage and a house that she does not want. Overall, the title character for Hedda Gabler is considered one of the great dramatic roles in theater.[5] The year following its publication, the play received negative feedback and reviews.\nThought 2: The world premiere of Hedda Gabler took place on 31 January 1891 at the Residenztheater in Munich, not at the Battle of Hastings. Now, I should verify when the Battle of Hastings took place to further disprove the claim. Action 2: Search[Battle of Hastings]\nAction 2: Search[Battle of Hastings]\nObservation 2: The Battle of Hastings[a] was fought on 14 October 1066 between the Norman-French army of William, Duke of Normandy, and an English army under the Anglo-Saxon King Harold Godwinson, beginning the Norman Conquest of England. It took place approximately 7\u00a0mi (11\u00a0km) northwest of Hastings, close to the present-day town of Battle, East Sussex, and was a decisive Norman victory.. The background to the battle was the death of the childless King Edward the Confessor in January 1066, which set up a succession struggle between several claimants to his throne. Harold was crowned king shortly after Edward's death, but faced invasions by William, his own brother Tostig, and the Norwegian King Harald Hardrada (Harold III of Norway). Hardrada and Tostig defeated a hastily gathered army of Englishmen at the Battle of Fulford on 20 September 1066, and were in turn defeated by Harold at the Battle of Stamford Bridge five days later.\nThought 3: The Battle of Hastings took place on 14 October 1066, which is centuries before the premiere of Hedda Gabler.

Founded in 1897 by a group of Torinese students, the club has worn a black and white striped home kit since 1903 and has played home matches in different grounds around its city, the latest being the 41,507-capacity Juventus Stadium. Nicknamed la Vecchia Signora (\"the Old Lady\"), the club has won 36 official league titles, 15 Coppa Italia trophies and nine Italian Super Cups, being the record holder for all these competitions; they also hold two Intercontinental Cups, two European Cup / UEFA Champions Leagues, one European Cup Winners' Cup, three UEFA Cups (Italian record), two UEFA Super Cups and one UEFA Intertoto Cup (Italian record).[6][7] Consequently, the side leads the historical Federazione Italiana Giuoco Calcio (FIGC) classification,[c] whilst on the international stage the club occupies the sixth position in Europe and the twelfth in the world for most confederation titles won with eleven trophies,[9] as well as the fourth in the all-time Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) competitions ranking,[d] having obtained the highest coefficient score during seven seasons since its introduction in 1979, the most for an Italian team in both cases and joint second overall in the last cited.. Founded with the name of Sport-Club Juventus, initially as an athletics club,[11] it is the second oldest of its kind still active in the country after Genoa's football section (1893) and has competed every season of the premier club division (reformulated in different formats until the Serie A inception in 1929) since its debut in 1900 with the exception of the 2006\u201307 season, being managed by the industrial Agnelli family almost continuously since 1923.[e] The relationship between the club and that dynasty is the oldest and longest in national sports, making Juventus one of the first professional sporting clubs ante litteram in the country,[13] having established itself as a major force in the national stage since the 1930s and at confederation level since the mid-1970s,[14] and becoming, in a nearly stable basis, one of the top-ten wealthiest in world football in terms of value, revenue and profit since the mid-1990s,[15] being listed on the Borsa Italiana since 2001.[16]. Under the management of Giovanni Trapattoni, the club won 13 trophies in the ten years before 1986, including six league titles and five international tournaments, and became the first to win all three seasonal competitions organised by the Union of European Football Associations: the 1976\u201377 UEFA Cup (first Southern European side to do so), the 1983\u201384 Cup Winners' Cup and the 1984\u201385 European Champions' Cup.[17] With successive triumphs in the 1984 European Super Cup and 1985 Intercontinental Cup, it became the first and thus far only in the world to complete a clean sweep of all five historical confederation trophies;[18] an achievement that they revalidated with the title won in the 1999 UEFA Intertoto Cup after another successful era led by Marcello Lippi,[19] becoming in addition, until 2022, the only professional Italian club to have won every ongoing honour available to the first team and organised by a national or international football association.[f] In December 2000, Juventus was placed seventh in the FIFA's historic ranking of the best clubs in the world,[20] and nine years later was ranked second best club in Europe during the 20th century based on a statistical study series by the International Federation of Football History & Statistics (IFFHS), the highest for an Italian club in both.[21].\nThought 2: The observation from the Wikipedia page of Juventus F.C. confirms that the club has worn a black and white striped home kit since 1903.

He has been a senator for Florence since 2018.[1] Renzi has served as the leader of Italia Viva (IV) since 2019,[2] having been the secretary of the Democratic Party (PD) from 2013 to 2018,[3] with a brief interruption in 2017.[4]. After serving as the president of the province of Florence from 2004 to 2009 and the mayor of Florence from 2009 to 2014,[5] Renzi was elected secretary of the PD in 2013, becoming prime minister the following year.[6] At the age of 39 years, Renzi, who was at the time the youngest leader in the G7 and also the first-serving mayor to become prime minister, became the youngest person to have served as prime minister.[7] While in power, Renzi's government implemented numerous reforms, including changes to the Italian electoral law, a relaxation of labour and employment laws with the intention of boosting economic growth,[8] a thorough reformation of the public administration, the simplification of civil trials, the introduction of same-sex civil unions,[9] and the abolition of many small taxes.[10]. After the rejection of his constitutional reform in the 2016 Italian constitutional referendum,[11][12] Renzi formally resigned as prime minister on 12 December; his Foreign Minister Paolo Gentiloni was appointed his replacement.[13][14] He resigned as secretary of the PD following defeat in the 2018 Italian general election.[15] In September 2019, he left the PD and founded the Italia Viva party.[16] In January 2021, Renzi revoked his party's support to the Conte II Cabinet headed by Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, which brought down the government and resulted in the 2021 Italian government crisis.[17] In February 2021, Renzi's IV supported Prime Minister Mario Draghi's national unity government.[18] Renzi has been described as a centrist and as a liberal by political observers.[19][20][21].

In 1968, three of the genre's most famous pioneers \u2013 British bands Led Zeppelin, Black Sabbath and Deep Purple \u2013 were founded.[3] Though they came to attract wide audiences, they were often derided by critics. Several American bands modified heavy metal into more accessible forms during the 1970s: the raw, sleazy sound and shock rock of Alice Cooper and Kiss; the blues-rooted rock of Aerosmith; and the flashy guitar leads and party rock of Van Halen.[4] During the mid-1970s, Judas Priest helped spur the genre's evolution by discarding much of its blues influence,[5][6] while Mot\u00f6rhead introduced a punk rock sensibility and an increasing emphasis on speed. Beginning in the late 1970s, bands in the new wave of British heavy metal such as Iron Maiden and Saxon followed in a similar vein.

That year, he created and produced the television series Punk'd, also serving as host for the first eight of its ten seasons.\nThought 3: The search for Ashton Kutcher's filmography didn't provide new information. I should try to search for George Clooney's filmography to see if he has ever directed Ashton Kutcher.

He is one of the highest-grossing actors of all time with over $2.6\u00a0billion total box office gross and an average of $61.7\u00a0million per film.[1] He has been involved in thirteen films that grossed over $200\u00a0million at the worldwide box office.[2]. Clooney starred in the television series The Facts of Life (1985\u20131987), Roseanne (1988\u20131991), Bodies of Evidence (1992\u20131993), Sisters (1993\u20131994) and ER (1994\u20131999). Early in his career, Clooney also appeared in a number of low-budget film roles like Grizzly II: Revenge (1983), Return to Horror High (1987), Combat Academy (1987), Return of the Killer Tomatoes (1988), Unbecoming Age (1992) and The Harvest (1993). His role as doctor Doug Ross on ER earned him Golden Globe and Emmy Award nominations.[3][4].\nThought 4: The information about George Clooney's filmography is also incomplete in this passage.

Along with its women's clothing counterpart Topshop and the rest of Arcadia Group, Topman went into administration in late 2020. All high street stores subsequently closed and the brand was purchased by ASOS on 1 February 2021, relaunching as an online-only retailer.[2]. In 2001, Topman's brand director, David Shepherd, was considered to have \"done a Ratner\" when he referred to his core clientele as \"Football hooligans or whatever\" and said that \"Very few of our customers have to wear suits to work. They'll be for his first interview or court case\".[3].\nThought 2: The information provided does not mention anything about Topman's presence in Ireland. However, it does mention that Topman has become an online-only retailer. This could potentially mean that they no longer have physical stores anywhere, including Ireland.

Wales (Welsh: Cymru [\u02c8k\u0259mr\u0268] \u24d8) is a country that is part of the United Kingdom. It is bordered by the Irish Sea to the north and west, England to the east, the Bristol Channel to the south, and the Celtic Sea to the south-west. As of 2021[update], it had a population of 3,107,494.[3] It has a total area of 21,218 square kilometres (8,192\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) and over 2,700 kilometres (1,680\u00a0mi) of coastline.[9] It is largely mountainous with its higher peaks in the north and central areas, including Snowdon (Yr Wyddfa), its highest summit.[15] The country lies within the north temperate zone and has a changeable, maritime climate.

Action 3: Search[Demographics of Wales]\nAction 3: Search[Demographics of Wales]\nObservation 3: Demographics of Wales include population, place of birth, age, ethnicity, religion, and number of marriages in Wales.. The population of Wales doubled from 587,000 in 1801 to 1,163,000 in 1851 and had reached 2,421,000 by 1911. Most of the increase came in the coal mining districts, especially Glamorganshire, which grew from 71,000 in 1801 to 232,000 in 1851, and to 1,122,000 in 1911.[5] Part of this increase can be attributed to the demographic transition seen in most industrialising countries during the Industrial Revolution, as death-rates dropped and birth-rates remained steady. However, there was also a large-scale migration of people into Wales during the Industrial Revolution.. The 2021 census showed Wales' population to be 3,107,500, the highest in its history.[6] In 2011, 27 per cent (837,000) of the total population of Wales were not born in Wales,[7][8] including 636,000 people (21 per cent of the total population of Wales) who were born in England.[9] The main population and industrial areas are in South Wales, including the cities of Cardiff, Swansea and Newport and the nearby valleys, with another significant population in the north-east around Wrexham and Flintshire..\nThought 4: The historical population of Wales was 587,000 in 1801, 1,163,000 in 1851, and 2,421,000 by 1911.

I'm not sure if \"Tool\" refers to a person, a band, or something else. I should start by searching for \"Tool\" to gather more information.\nAction 1: Search[Tool]\nObservation 1: A tool is an object that can extend an individual's ability to modify features of the surrounding environment or help them accomplish a particular task. Although many animals use simple tools, only human beings, whose use of stone tools dates back hundreds of millennia, have been observed using tools to make other tools.. Early human tools, made of such materials as stone, bone, and wood, were used for the preparation of food, hunting, the manufacture of weapons, and the working of materials to produce clothing and useful artifacts and crafts such as pottery, along with the construction of housing, businesses, infrastructure, and transportation. The development of metalworking made additional types of tools possible. Harnessing energy sources, such as animal power, wind, or steam, allowed increasingly complex tools to produce an even larger range of items, with the Industrial Revolution marking an inflection point in the use of tools.\nThought 2: The information provided does not relate to the claim. It seems \"Tool\" in this context might refer to a band or a person. I should search for \"Tool (band)\" and \"Tool (person)\" to see if I can find more relevant information.\nAction 2: Search[Tool (band)]\nObservation 2: Tool is an American rock band from Los Angeles. Formed in 1990, the group consists of vocalist Maynard James Keenan, guitarist Adam Jones, drummer Danny Carey and bassist Justin Chancellor, who replaced founding member Paul D'Amour in 1995. Tool has won four Grammy Awards,[1] performed worldwide tours, and produced albums topping the charts in several countries.. To date, the band has released five studio albums, one EP and one box set. It emerged with a heavy metal sound on their first studio album, Undertow (1993), and became a dominant act in the alternative metal movement with the release of their follow-up album \u00c6nima in 1996.\nThought 3: The band Tool has won four Grammy Awards, not three Oscars.
