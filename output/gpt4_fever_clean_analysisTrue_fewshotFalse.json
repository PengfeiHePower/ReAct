He played six seasons for the San Francisco 49ers in the National Football League (NFL). In 2016, he knelt during the national anthem at the start of NFL games in protest of police brutality and racial inequality in the United States.[2][3][4]. Kaepernick played college football for the Nevada Wolf Pack, where he was named the Western Athletic Conference (WAC) Offensive Player of the Year twice and became the only player in NCAA Division I history to amass 10,000 passing yards and 4,000 rushing yards in a career. After graduating, he was selected by the 49ers in the second round of the 2011 NFL Draft.\nThought 2: From the information gathered, Colin Kaepernick was selected by the 49ers in the second round of the 2011 NFL Draft. However, it doesn't specify when he started as a quarterback for the team. I need to find more specific information about when he started in this role.\nAction 2: Lookup[\"quarterback\"]\nObservation 2: No more results.\n\nThought 3: The search for \"quarterback\" in the current passage didn't yield any more results.

However, the search suggests looking at specific seasons. The 2012 season might be a good place to start since Kaepernick was drafted in 2011.\nAction 4: Search[2012 San Francisco 49ers season]\nObservation 4: The 2012 San Francisco 49ers season was the franchise's 63rd season in the National Football League (NFL), the 67th overall, the second under the head coach/general manager tandem of Jim Harbaugh and Trent Baalke, and their penultimate season at Candlestick Park. After going 13\u20133 and reaching the NFC Championship the year before, the 49ers topped that success with their first NFC championship since 1994 as well as their sixth overall as a franchise, overcoming a 17\u20130 deficit to defeat the Atlanta Falcons 28\u201324 on January 20, 2013, in the NFC title game. However, the season ended with their first-ever defeat in the Super Bowl, falling to the Baltimore Ravens, 34\u201331. With that game, the Ravens replaced the 49ers as the only team with multiple appearances to never lose a Super Bowl; they have since been joined by the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in this capacity.. This season was also highlighted by the signing of star wide receiver Randy Moss, who had come out of retirement after initially retiring following the 2010 season.\nThought 5: The 2012 season was the 49ers' 63rd season in the NFL. However, there's no mention of Colin Kaepernick starting as a quarterback in this season. I need to find more specific information about Kaepernick's role in this season.\nAction 5: Lookup[\"Colin Kaepernick\"]\nObservation 5: Colin Kaepernick became the starting quarterback in the middle of the season after Alex Smith suffered a concussion in the second quarter of the team's ninth game.

Known for her roles in independent films and blockbusters, she has received various accolades, including an Academy Award and a British Academy Film Award, in addition to nominations for three Golden Globe Awards. In 2020, The New York Times ranked her as one of the greatest actors of the 21st century.[1].

Swinton won the Volpi Cup for Best Actress at the Venice Film Festival for her portrayal of Isabella of France in Edward II (1991).\nThought 2: The Wikipedia page provides a lot of information about Tilda Swinton's career, but it doesn't mention anything about her diet or lifestyle choices.

However, the suggestion of 'Okja' is interesting because it's a film in which Tilda Swinton starred, and it has themes of animal rights and veganism. It's possible that in interviews or discussions about this film, Tilda Swinton may have spoken about her own dietary choices.

The film is about a young girl who raised a genetically modified \"super pig\" (the titular Okja), and, after she is taken to the United States, goes on a mission to rescue her from mistreatment at the hands of the meat industry. An international co-production of South Korea and the United States, it stars an ensemble cast headed by child actor Ahn Seo-hyun, along with Byun Hee-bong, Yoon Je-moon, Choi Woo-shik, Tilda Swinton, Paul Dano, Steven Yeun, Lily Collins, Shirley Henderson, Daniel Henshall, Devon Bostick, Giancarlo Esposito, and Jake Gyllenhaal.. The film competed for the Palme d'Or in the main competition section at the 2017 Cannes Film Festival.[4][5] It was released on Netflix on June 28, 2017. The film received positive reviews from critics..\nThought 4: The information about the film 'Okja' does not provide any direct insight into Tilda Swinton's personal dietary choices.

Mogadishu enjoyed the height of its prosperity during the 14th and 15th centuries[10]  and was during the early modern period considered the wealthiest city on the East African coast, as well as the center of a thriving textile industry.[11] In the 17th century, Mogadishu and parts of southern Somalia fell under the Hiraab Imamate.\nThought 2: The Wikipedia entry for Mogadishu confirms that it is the capital city of Somalia.

The series' premise originated with Paul Attanasio, while David Shore, who is credited as creator, was primarily responsible for conceiving the title character.. House often clashes with his fellow physicians, including his own diagnostic team, because many of his hypotheses about patients' illnesses are based on subtle or controversial insights.\nThought 2: The television show 'House' is described as an American medical drama.

Sitcoms can be contrasted with sketch comedy, where a troupe may use new characters in each sketch, and stand-up comedy, where a comedian tells jokes and stories to an audience. Sitcoms originated in radio, but today are found mostly on television as one of its dominant narrative forms.. A sitcom may be recorded in front of a studio audience, depending on the program's production format. The effect of a live studio audience can be imitated or enhanced by the use of a laugh track..\nThought 3: A sitcom, or situation comedy, is a genre of comedy that revolves around a fixed set of characters who carry over from episode to episode.

The Chicxulub impact is believed to have caused the mass extinction at the end of the Cretaceous period, which included the extinction of the non-avian dinosaurs.

Sir Donald George Bradman AC (27 August 1908 \u2013 25 February 2001), nicknamed \"The Don\", was an Australian international cricketer, widely acknowledged as the greatest  batsman of all time.[3] His cricketing successes have been claimed by Shane Warne, among others, to make Bradman the \"greatest sportsperson\" in history.[4][5][6] Bradman's career Test batting average of 99.94 is considered by some to be the greatest achievement by any sportsman in any major sport.[7]. Although Bradman reportedly disliked fame, his iconic status made him one of Australia's best-known personalities and arguably the country's \"first celebrity\".[8]. The story that the young Bradman practised alone with a cricket stump and a golf ball is part of Australian folklore.[9] His meteoric rise from bush cricket to the Australian Test team took just over two years. Before his 22nd birthday, he had set many records for top scoring, some of which still stand, and became Australia's sporting idol at the height of the Great Depression.\nThought 2: Don Bradman was an Australian international cricketer, not a soccer player. He is widely acknowledged as the greatest batsman of all time. There's no mention of him playing soccer professionally. I should confirm this by looking up if he ever played soccer.\nAction 2: Search[Don Bradman soccer]\nObservation 2: Could not find Don Bradman soccer.

It seems he was only involved in cricket. Therefore, it's safe to conclude that he didn't retire from soccer as he never played it professionally. I can now finish the task with the answer.\nAction 3: Finish[No, Don Bradman did not retire from soccer.

She is best known for her roles as Charlotte in the BBC crime drama series Bergerac, Margaret Blaine in the BBC science fiction series Doctor Who, Mrs Glenna Fitzgibbons in the first season of Outlander, Babe Smith in the BBC soap opera EastEnders, and as Dr Fleur Perkins on the ITV mystery series Midsomer Murders. She was nominated for the Laurence Olivier Award for Best Actress in a Supporting Role in 1993 for her performance as Sadie in Jim Cartwright's play The Rise and Fall of Little Voice; a role she reprised in the 1998 film adaptation Little Voice.[1]. Badland was born on 26 August 1950 in Edgbaston, Birmingham. Her mother, originally from Loanhead, Scotland, relocated to Birmingham during World War II to work as a munitions and aircraft worker in the factories, where she met Badland's father.[2] Her family often returned to Scotland for holidays and to visit family, or sometimes they holidayed in Wales.[3][2] Badland trained in acting at East 15 Acting School in Loughton, Essex, working in \"rep\" at Southwold Summer Theatre during her time there.\nThought 2: Annette Badland is an English actress known for her roles in television, radio, stage, and film. Given her profession, it seems unlikely that she would have participated in the 2015 NBA Finals, which is a basketball event. However, she could have been present as a spectator. To confirm this, I need to find out more about the 2015 NBA Finals. I will use the Search action to find information about the 2015 NBA Finals.\nAction 2: Search[\"2015 NBA Finals\"]\nObservation 2: The 2015 NBA Finals was the championship series of the National Basketball Association's (NBA) 2014\u201315 season and the conclusion of the season's playoffs played from June 4 to 16, 2015.

The Warriors, led by the duo of Klay Thompson and 2014\u201315 MVP Stephen Curry, won the opening game at home in overtime. However, despite the loss of an injured Kevin Love and Kyrie Irving during most of the series, the Cavaliers, led by LeBron James (in his fifth consecutive Finals appearance, and sixth overall[1]) managed to take a 2\u20131 series lead before the Warriors won the last three for their first title since 1975.. Golden State's Andre Iguodala was named NBA Finals Most Valuable Player (MVP).\nThought 3: The 2015 NBA Finals was a basketball event contested by the Golden State Warriors and the Cleveland Cavaliers. There is no mention of Annette Badland in the information about the event. Given that she is an actress and not a professional athlete, it is highly unlikely that she participated in the event. However, to confirm whether she was present at the event, I would need to find specific information about her presence or participation in the 2015 NBA Finals.

With MGM, she appeared in many films which spanned a wide variety of genres, which include the crime-drama Act of Violence (1948), the drama Little Women (1949), the comedy Angels in the Outfield (1951), the romance Scaramouche (1952) and the western drama The Naked Spur (1953).\nThought 2: Janet Leigh was indeed an actress, and she had a career that spanned over five decades.

He played six seasons for the San Francisco 49ers in the National Football League (NFL). In 2016, he knelt during the national anthem at the start of NFL games in protest of police brutality and racial inequality in the United States.[2][3][4]. Kaepernick played college football for the Nevada Wolf Pack, where he was named the Western Athletic Conference (WAC) Offensive Player of the Year twice and became the only player in NCAA Division I history to amass 10,000 passing yards and 4,000 rushing yards in a career. After graduating, he was selected by the 49ers in the second round of the 2011 NFL Draft.\nThought 2: The information shows that Colin Kaepernick played for the San Francisco 49ers for six seasons, but it doesn't specify when he became a starter.

After going 13\u20133 and reaching the NFC Championship the year before, the 49ers topped that success with their first NFC championship since 1994 as well as their sixth overall as a franchise, overcoming a 17\u20130 deficit to defeat the Atlanta Falcons 28\u201324 on January 20, 2013, in the NFC title game. However, the season ended with their first-ever defeat in the Super Bowl, falling to the Baltimore Ravens, 34\u201331. With that game, the Ravens replaced the 49ers as the only team with multiple appearances to never lose a Super Bowl; they have since been joined by the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in this capacity.. This season was also highlighted by the signing of star wide receiver Randy Moss, who had come out of retirement after initially retiring following the 2010 season.\nThought 5: The 2012 season was indeed the 49ers' 63rd season in the NFL.

The protests began in the 2016 preseason when then-San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick sat, and later knelt, during the national anthem, before his team's games. Kaepernick described his behavior as a protest against racial injustice, police brutality, and systematic oppression in the United States. The protests received highly polarized reactions, with some praising him and his stand against racism and others denouncing the protests as disrespectful to the American flag and military. The protests have been a topic of heated political controversy, with President Donald Trump notably criticizing the protests and calling for the firing of NFL players who participate.\nThought 7: The kneeling protests initiated by Kaepernick were indeed a topic of political controversy.

Known as the \"Master of Suspense\", Hitchcock became as well known as any of his actors thanks to his many interviews, his cameo appearances in most of his films, and his hosting and producing the television anthology Alfred Hitchcock Presents (1955\u201365). His films garnered 46 Academy Award nominations, including six wins, although he never won the award for Best Director, despite five nominations.. Hitchcock initially trained as a technical clerk and copywriter before entering the film industry in 1919 as a title card designer.\nThought 4: Alfred Hitchcock is known as the \"Master of Suspense\", not the \"Master of Nothing\".

My first step will be to search for the song \"Hot Right Now\" on Wikipedia to see who is listed as the artist.\nAction 1: Search[\"Hot Right Now\"]\nObservation 1: \"Hot Right Now\" is a single by English drum and bass producer DJ Fresh featuring English singer Rita Ora, released on 13 February 2012 as the second single from his third studio album, Nextlevelism (2012), before later being included as a bonus track on Ora's debut studio album Ora (2012).. \"Hot Right Now\" debuted at the top of UK Singles Chart on 19 February 2012.[2] The Official Charts Company confirmed \"Hot Right Now\" as the UK's first ever drum and bass number one.[3]. In July 2011, DJ Fresh released \"Louder\", the first single from his third studio album, Nextlevelism. It reached peak position on the UK Singles Chart, giving DJ Fresh his first ever number one.[4] After \"Louder\", Fresh started working on \"Hot Right Now\" and as he was looking for a vocalist for the song, he came across Ora's cover videos on YouTube.[5] Daniel Stein and The Invisible Men wrote the song while Daniel Stein and Wez Clarke produced it.. Robert Copsey of Digital Spy gave the song a mixed review stating:.\nThought 2: The song \"Hot Right Now\" is indeed credited to DJ Fresh, and it features the singer Rita Ora. The song was released as the second single from DJ Fresh's third studio album, Nextlevelism. The song was written by Daniel Stein (DJ Fresh) and The Invisible Men, and it was produced by Daniel Stein and Wez Clarke. This information suggests that the song is not mistakenly attributed to DJ Fresh. However, to be thorough, I should look for any evidence that suggests otherwise. I will now search for DJ Fresh to see if there is any controversy or dispute over the attribution of the song.\nAction 2: Search[\"DJ Fresh\"]\nObservation 2: Daniel Edward Stein (born 11 April 1977), known professionally as DJ Fresh, is an English DJ and record producer. He is one of the principal members of the drum and bass group Bad Company,[1][failed verification] alongside Darren White (dBridge), Jason Maldini and Michael Wojcicki (Vegas). He also owns and runs the drum and bass label Breakbeat Kaos with Adam F.[2]. DJ Fresh released his third studio album, Nextlevelism, in October 2012 on Ministry of Sound Recordings,[3] which includes the two number one hit singles \"Louder\" and \"Hot Right Now\" \u2013 the UK's first dubstep and drum and bass number ones respectively[4] \u2013 \"The Power\", \"The Feeling\", \"Gravity\" and \"Gold Dust\".. DJ Fresh scored his fourth top five single with \"Earthquake\", a collaboration with Mad Decent label boss Diplo, featuring Dominique Young Unique, \"Dibby Dibby Sound\", a collaboration with St.\nThought 3: DJ Fresh, whose real name is Daniel Edward Stein, is indeed credited with the song \"Hot Right Now\" in his professional career. The song is listed as one of the two number one hit singles from his third studio album, Nextlevelism. There is no mention of any controversy or dispute over the attribution of the song.

I'll start by searching for Aristotle to get a general overview of his life. \nAction 1: Search[Aristotle]\nObservation 1: Aristotle[A] (Greek: \u1f08\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03c4\u03ad\u03bb\u03b7\u03c2 Aristot\u00e9l\u0113s;[B] 384\u2013322\u00a0BC) was an Ancient Greek philosopher and polymath. His writings cover a broad range of subjects spanning the natural sciences, philosophy, linguistics, economics, politics, psychology, and the arts. As the founder of the Peripatetic school of philosophy in the Lyceum in Athens, he began the wider Aristotelian tradition that followed, which set the groundwork for the development of modern science.. Little is known about Aristotle's life. He was born in the city of Stagira in northern Greece during the Classical period.\nThought 2: The information about Aristotle confirms that he was an Ancient Greek philosopher and polymath. It also mentions that he founded the Peripatetic school of philosophy in the Lyceum in Athens. This suggests that he did spend time in Athens. However, to be sure, I should look for more specific information about his time in Athens.\nAction 2: Search[Aristotle in Athens]\nObservation 2: Could not find Aristotle in Athens.

It was best known for the Peripatetic school of philosophy founded there by Aristotle in 334 BC. Aristotle fled Athens in 323 BC,[2] and the university continued to function after his lifetime under a series of leaders until the Roman general Sulla destroyed it during his assault on Athens in 86 BC.[3]. The remains of the Lyceum were discovered in modern Athens in 1996 in a park behind the Hellenic Parliament.[4]. The Lyceum had been used for philosophical debate long before Aristotle.\nThought 4: The information about the Lyceum confirms that Aristotle founded the Peripatetic school of philosophy there in 334 BC.

Although he long tried to get both countries to adopt a closer political union, the kingdoms of Scotland and England remained sovereign states, with their own parliaments, judiciaries, and laws, ruled by James in personal union. He was the longest-reigning monarch of the Kingdom of Scotland.. James was the son of Mary, Queen of Scots, and a great-great-grandson of Henry VII, King of England and Lord of Ireland, and thus a potential successor to all three thrones.

I will start by searching for Saxony on Wikipedia to get a clear understanding of its geographical location. \nAction 1: Search[Saxony]\nObservation 1: Saxony,[a] officially the Free State of Saxony,[b] is a landlocked state of Germany, bordering the states of Brandenburg, Saxony-Anhalt, Thuringia, Bavaria, as well as the countries of Poland and the Czech Republic. Its capital is Dresden, and its largest city is Leipzig. Saxony is the tenth largest of Germany's sixteen states, with an area of 18,413 square kilometres (7,109\u00a0sq\u00a0mi), and the sixth most populous, with more than 4 million inhabitants.. The state is also home to a minority of Sorbs, a West Slavic ethnic group native to the area, numbering an estimated 80,000 people.[3]. The term Saxony has been in use for more than a millennium.\nThought 2: From the information gathered, Saxony is a state in Germany and it borders other German states and countries like Poland and the Czech Republic. It does not mention Ireland, so it seems unlikely that Saxony is part of Ireland. However, to be sure, I should also search for Ireland and see if there's any mention of Saxony there.\nAction 2: Search[Ireland]\nObservation 2: in Europe\u00a0(dark grey). Ireland (/\u02c8a\u026a\u0259rl\u0259nd/ \u24d8 IRE-l\u0259nd; Irish: \u00c9ire [\u02c8e\u02d0\u027e\u02b2\u0259] \u24d8; Ulster-Scots: Airlann [\u02c8\u0251\u02d0rl\u0259n]) is an island in the North Atlantic Ocean, in north-western Europe. It is separated from Great Britain to its east by the North Channel, the Irish Sea, and St George's Channel. Ireland is the second-largest island of the British Isles, the third-largest in Europe, and the twentieth-largest in the world.[10] Geopolitically, the island is divided between the Republic of Ireland (officially named Ireland), an independent state covering five-sixths of the island, and Northern Ireland, which is part of the United Kingdom. As of 2022, the population of the entire island is just over 7\u00a0million, with 5.1 million living in the Republic of Ireland and 1.9 million in Northern Ireland, ranking it the second-most populous island in Europe after Great Britain.[11].\nThought 3: Ireland is an island in the North Atlantic Ocean, in north-western Europe. It is separated from Great Britain and is divided between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland. There is no mention of Saxony being a part of Ireland in this information. Therefore, it is safe to conclude that Saxony is not a part of Ireland.\nAction 3: Finish[No, Saxony is not a part of Ireland.

I can do this by searching for the movie on Wikipedia and looking at its genre classification. \nAction 1: Search[\"A View to a Kill\"]\nObservation 1: A View to a Kill is a 1985 spy film, the fourteenth in the James Bond series produced by Eon Productions, and the seventh and final appearance of Roger Moore as the fictional MI6 agent James Bond. Although the title is adapted from Ian Fleming's 1960 short story \"From a View to a Kill\", the film has an entirely original screenplay. In A View to a Kill, Bond is pitted against Max Zorin (played by Christopher Walken), who plans to destroy California's Silicon Valley.. The film was produced by Albert R. Broccoli and Michael G.\nThought 2: The movie \"A View to a Kill\" is classified as a spy film. However, spy films often contain elements of action. To confirm whether it can also be considered an action movie, I need to understand what defines an action movie. \nAction 2: Search[\"Action movie\"]\nObservation 2: The action film is a film genre that predominantly features chase sequences, fights, shootouts, explosions, and stunt work. The specifics of what constitutes an action film has been in scholarly debate since the 1980s. While some scholars such as David Bordwell suggested they were films that favor spectacle to storytelling, others such as Goeff King stated they allow the scenes of spectacle to be attuned to story telling. Action films are often hybrid with other genres, mixing into various forms ranging to comedies, science fiction films, and horror films.. While the term \"action film\" or \"action adventure film\" has been used as early as the 1910s, the contemporary definition usually refers to a film that came with the arrival of New Hollywood and the rise of antiheros appearing in American films of the late 1960s and 1970s drawing from war films, crime films and Westerns.\nThought 3: Action movies are characterized by chase sequences, fights, shootouts, explosions, and stunt work. They often mix with other genres, including spy films. Given that \"A View to a Kill\" is a James Bond film, it likely contains many of these elements.

The Principate system of government was established during his reign and lasted until the Crisis of the Third Century.. Octavian was born into an equestrian branch of the plebeian gens Octavia. His maternal great-uncle Julius Caesar was assassinated in 44 BC, and Octavian was named in Caesar's will as his adopted son and heir; as a result, he inherited Caesar's name, estate, and the loyalty of his legions.\nThought 3: Augustus was the founder of the Roman Empire and its first emperor.

Underwood was born November 6, 1953, in Glendale, California. In school he lived in Ceylon, now Sri Lanka, as an AFS Intercultural Programs exchange student. After graduating from high school, he briefly attended Occidental College as a pre-med student, but transferred to the USC School of Cinema (now USC School of Cinematic Arts) after deciding to become a filmmaker. Underwood majored in cinema with a minor in anthropology.\nThought 2: Ron Underwood is a film and television director, not a film critic.

The world premiere was staged on 31 January 1891 at the Residenztheater in Munich. Ibsen himself was in attendance, although he remained back-stage.[1] The play has been canonized as a masterpiece within the genres of literary realism, nineteenth century theatre, and world drama.[2][3][4]  Ibsen mainly wrote realistic plays until his forays into modern drama. Hedda Gabler dramatizes the experiences of the title character, Hedda, the daughter of a general, who is trapped in a marriage and a house that she does not want. Overall, the title character for Hedda Gabler is considered one of the great dramatic roles in theater.[5] The year following its publication, the play received negative feedback and reviews.\nThought 3: The world premiere of Hedda Gabler was staged on 31 January 1891 at the Residenztheater in Munich.

It took place approximately 7\u00a0mi (11\u00a0km) northwest of Hastings, close to the present-day town of Battle, East Sussex, and was a decisive Norman victory.. The background to the battle was the death of the childless King Edward the Confessor in January 1066, which set up a succession struggle between several claimants to his throne. Harold was crowned king shortly after Edward's death, but faced invasions by William, his own brother Tostig, and the Norwegian King Harald Hardrada (Harold III of Norway). Hardrada and Tostig defeated a hastily gathered army of Englishmen at the Battle of Fulford on 20 September 1066, and were in turn defeated by Harold at the Battle of Stamford Bridge five days later.\nThought 4: The Battle of Hastings took place on 14 October 1066, which is centuries before the premiere of Hedda Gabler in 1891.

Founded in 1897 by a group of Torinese students, the club has worn a black and white striped home kit since 1903 and has played home matches in different grounds around its city, the latest being the 41,507-capacity Juventus Stadium. Nicknamed la Vecchia Signora (\"the Old Lady\"), the club has won 36 official league titles, 15 Coppa Italia trophies and nine Italian Super Cups, being the record holder for all these competitions; they also hold two Intercontinental Cups, two European Cup / UEFA Champions Leagues, one European Cup Winners' Cup, three UEFA Cups (Italian record), two UEFA Super Cups and one UEFA Intertoto Cup (Italian record).[6][7] Consequently, the side leads the historical Federazione Italiana Giuoco Calcio (FIGC) classification,[c] whilst on the international stage the club occupies the sixth position in Europe and the twelfth in the world for most confederation titles won with eleven trophies,[9] as well as the fourth in the all-time Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) competitions ranking,[d] having obtained the highest coefficient score during seven seasons since its introduction in 1979, the most for an Italian team in both cases and joint second overall in the last cited.. Founded with the name of Sport-Club Juventus, initially as an athletics club,[11] it is the second oldest of its kind still active in the country after Genoa's football section (1893) and has competed every season of the premier club division (reformulated in different formats until the Serie A inception in 1929) since its debut in 1900 with the exception of the 2006\u201307 season, being managed by the industrial Agnelli family almost continuously since 1923.[e] The relationship between the club and that dynasty is the oldest and longest in national sports, making Juventus one of the first professional sporting clubs ante litteram in the country,[13] having established itself as a major force in the national stage since the 1930s and at confederation level since the mid-1970s,[14] and becoming, in a nearly stable basis, one of the top-ten wealthiest in world football in terms of value, revenue and profit since the mid-1990s,[15] being listed on the Borsa Italiana since 2001.[16]. Under the management of Giovanni Trapattoni, the club won 13 trophies in the ten years before 1986, including six league titles and five international tournaments, and became the first to win all three seasonal competitions organised by the Union of European Football Associations: the 1976\u201377 UEFA Cup (first Southern European side to do so), the 1983\u201384 Cup Winners' Cup and the 1984\u201385 European Champions' Cup.[17] With successive triumphs in the 1984 European Super Cup and 1985 Intercontinental Cup, it became the first and thus far only in the world to complete a clean sweep of all five historical confederation trophies;[18] an achievement that they revalidated with the title won in the 1999 UEFA Intertoto Cup after another successful era led by Marcello Lippi,[19] becoming in addition, until 2022, the only professional Italian club to have won every ongoing honour available to the first team and organised by a national or international football association.[f] In December 2000, Juventus was placed seventh in the FIFA's historic ranking of the best clubs in the world,[20] and nine years later was ranked second best club in Europe during the 20th century based on a statistical study series by the International Federation of Football History & Statistics (IFFHS), the highest for an Italian club in both.[21].\nThought 2: The observation confirms that Juventus F.C. has worn a black and white striped home kit since 1903.

Starrcade was regarded by the NWA and WCW as their flagship event of the year, much in the same vein that its rival, the World Wrestling Federation (WWF), regarded WrestleMania.

Jack Ryan Falahee was born on February 20, 1989, and raised in Ann Arbor, Michigan, the son of a speech pathologist mother and a neurosurgeon father.[3][4] He is of Irish and Italian descent.[5] Growing up, Falahee attended a Catholic school described as \"rigorous\".[5] He began acting while attending Huron High School.[6] In 2011, Falahee graduated from New York University's Tisch School of the Arts with a Bachelor of Fine Arts in Drama, where he studied acting and performed in a number of productions, including Love's Labour's Lost, A Midsummer Night's Dream and Sondheim's Company.[7] His first screen acting job was in 2012, with a guest starring role in the comedy web series Submissions Only. Also in that year he had the leading role in the short film Sunburn.[8] He also studied acting at the International Theater Workshop in Amsterdam.[2]. Falahee made his television debut in 2013, with a guest-starring role in The CW teen comedy-drama series The Carrie Diaries and later appeared on the short-lived NBC series Ironside.\nThought 2: The Wikipedia entry for Jack Falahee confirms that he is an American actor and singer.

He played six seasons for the San Francisco 49ers in the National Football League (NFL). In 2016, he knelt during the national anthem at the start of NFL games in protest of police brutality and racial inequality in the United States.[2][3][4]. Kaepernick played college football for the Nevada Wolf Pack, where he was named the Western Athletic Conference (WAC) Offensive Player of the Year twice and became the only player in NCAA Division I history to amass 10,000 passing yards and 4,000 rushing yards in a career. After graduating, he was selected by the 49ers in the second round of the 2011 NFL Draft.\nThought 2: Colin Kaepernick is known as an American civil rights activist and former football quarterback. He played for the San Francisco 49ers in the NFL and is known for his protest against police brutality and racial inequality. There is no mention of him being a poker player in this information.

He has been a senator for Florence since 2018.[1] Renzi has served as the leader of Italia Viva (IV) since 2019,[2] having been the secretary of the Democratic Party (PD) from 2013 to 2018,[3] with a brief interruption in 2017.[4]. After serving as the president of the province of Florence from 2004 to 2009 and the mayor of Florence from 2009 to 2014,[5] Renzi was elected secretary of the PD in 2013, becoming prime minister the following year.[6] At the age of 39 years, Renzi, who was at the time the youngest leader in the G7 and also the first-serving mayor to become prime minister, became the youngest person to have served as prime minister.[7] While in power, Renzi's government implemented numerous reforms, including changes to the Italian electoral law, a relaxation of labour and employment laws with the intention of boosting economic growth,[8] a thorough reformation of the public administration, the simplification of civil trials, the introduction of same-sex civil unions,[9] and the abolition of many small taxes.[10]. After the rejection of his constitutional reform in the 2016 Italian constitutional referendum,[11][12] Renzi formally resigned as prime minister on 12 December; his Foreign Minister Paolo Gentiloni was appointed his replacement.[13][14] He resigned as secretary of the PD following defeat in the 2018 Italian general election.[15] In September 2019, he left the PD and founded the Italia Viva party.[16] In January 2021, Renzi revoked his party's support to the Conte II Cabinet headed by Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, which brought down the government and resulted in the 2021 Italian government crisis.[17] In February 2021, Renzi's IV supported Prime Minister Mario Draghi's national unity government.[18] Renzi has been described as a centrist and as a liberal by political observers.[19][20][21].

It stretches from central and eastern Afghanistan[2][3] into northwestern Pakistan and far southeastern Tajikistan. The range forms the western section of the Hindu Kush Himalayan Region (HKH);[4][5][6] to the north, near its northeastern end, the Hindu Kush buttresses the Pamir Mountains near the point where the borders of Afghanistan, China, and Pakistan meet, after which it runs southwest through Pakistan and into Afghanistan near their border.[2]. The eastern end of the Hindu Kush in the north merges with the Karakoram Range.[7][8] Towards its southern end, it connects with the White Mountains near the Kabul River.[9][10] It divides the valley of the Amu Darya (the ancient Oxus) to the north from the Indus River valley to the south.

Mount Everest attracts many climbers, including highly experienced mountaineers. There are two main climbing routes, one approaching the summit from the southeast in Nepal (known as the \"standard route\") and the other from the north in Tibet. While not posing substantial technical climbing challenges on the standard route, Everest presents dangers such as altitude sickness, weather, and wind, as well as hazards from avalanches and the Khumbu Icefall.\nThought 3: Mount Everest is located in the Mahalangur Himal sub-range of the Himalayas, which is different from the Hindu Kush.

I will search for this term next.\nAction 2: Search[\"Cardiac pacemaker\"]\nObservation 2: The contraction of cardiac muscle (heart muscle) in all animals is initiated by electrical impulses known as action potentials that in the heart are known as cardiac action potentials. The rate at which these impulses fire controls the rate of cardiac contraction, that is, the heart rate. The cells that create these rhythmic impulses, setting the pace for blood pumping, are called pacemaker cells, and they directly control the heart rate. They make up the cardiac pacemaker, that is, the natural pacemaker of the heart. In most humans, the highest concentration of pacemaker cells is in the sinoatrial (SA) node, the natural and primary pacemaker, and the resultant rhythm is a sinus rhythm..\nThought 3: The information about the 'Cardiac pacemaker' provides insight into how the heart rate is controlled, but it does not provide specific numbers for the average resting heart rate. I need to continue searching for this specific information.\nAction 3: Search[\"Resting heart rate\"]\nObservation 3: Heart rate is the frequency of the heartbeat measured by the number of contractions of the heart per minute (beats per minute, or bpm). The heart rate varies according to the body's physical needs, including the need to absorb oxygen and excrete carbon dioxide. It is also modulated by numerous factors, including (but not limited to) genetics, physical fitness, stress or psychological status, diet, drugs, hormonal status, environment, and disease/illness, as well as the interaction between these factors.[1] It is usually equal or close to the pulse rate measured at any peripheral point.[2]. The American Heart Association states the normal resting adult human heart rate is 60\u2013100 bpm. An ultra-trained athlete would have a resting heart rate of 37\u201338 bpm.[3] Tachycardia is a high heart rate, defined as above 100 bpm at rest.[4] Bradycardia is a low heart rate, defined as below 60 bpm at rest.\nThought 4: The information from the search \"Resting heart rate\" provides the answer to the first sub-question. The average resting heart rate for an adult human is 60-100 beats per minute (bpm), while an ultra-trained athlete might have a resting heart rate of 37-38 bpm. This suggests that a resting heart rate of 22 bpm is unusually low.

It is also influenced by numerous factors such as genetics, physical fitness, stress or psychological status, diet, drugs, hormonal status, environment, and disease/illness. This information should be sufficient to answer the second sub-question. Now, I need to address the final sub-question: \"Is 22 beats per minute within the normal range for a resting heart rate?\".\nAction 5: Lookup[\"22 beats per minute\"]\nObservation 5: No more results.\n\nThought 6: The lookup for \"22 beats per minute\" did not provide any additional information. However, based on the information gathered so far, a resting heart rate of 22 beats per minute is significantly lower than the normal range for an adult human (60-100 bpm) and even lower than that of an ultra-trained athlete (37-38 bpm). Therefore, it seems that 22 beats per minute is not within the normal range for a resting heart rate.

The show was hosted during its first season by comedian Jeong Hyeong-don and rapper Defconn.. The production company behind the show, Genie Pictures was acquired by FNC Add Culture on January 15, 2018,[5] while FNC Add Culture was acquired by SM Entertainment on May 18, 2018 and renamed SM Life Design Group.[6]. On February 22, 2018, MBC Every1 announced that both hosts would be stepping down from the show.[7][8][9]. Former Roo'ra member Lee Sang-min and comedians Yoo Se-yoon & Kim Shin-young were selected as the new hosts of the show's second season, which debuted on April 11, 2018.[10] On November 21, 2018, it was announced that all 3 hosts, current producers and crew will be departing the show in January 2019, and a restructuring of the program is expected.[11].\nThought 2: The information about the show \"Weekly Idol\" mentions several hosts, but Yoo Jae Suk is not among them. The hosts mentioned are Jeong Hyeong-don, Defconn, Lee Sang-min, Yoo Se-yoon, and Kim Shin-young. However, to be sure, I should also search for Yoo Jae Suk to see if he has any connection to the show that wasn't mentioned in the \"Weekly Idol\" article.\nAction 2: Search[\"Yoo Jae Suk\"]\nObservation 2: Yoo Jae-suk (Korean:\u00a0\uc720\uc7ac\uc11d; Korean pronunciation: [jud\u0361\u0291\u03b5s\u028ck\u031a] or [ju] [t\u0361\u0255\u03b5s\u028ck\u031a]; born on 14 August 1972) is a South Korean comedian, host and television personality. He has hosted several variety television shows in South Korea, including Infinite Challenge, Running Man, Happy Together, and Hangout With Yoo. Known for his quick wit and appeal across a wide range of demographics, Yoo has established himself as one of South Korea's top comedians and TV personalities, as well as one of the most well-known and popular celebrities in South Korea.[2][3]. Born on 14 August 1972 in Suyu-dong, Gangbuk-gu, Seoul,[1] Yoo is the eldest of three siblings. In 1991, he completed his high school education and graduated from the Yongmoon High School in Seoul.\nThought 3: The information about Yoo Jae Suk mentions several shows he has hosted, but \"Weekly Idol\" is not among them. The shows mentioned are Infinite Challenge, Running Man, Happy Together, and Hangout With Yoo. Based on these observations, it seems that Yoo Jae Suk is not the host of \"Weekly Idol\".

The earliest suggestion of unusual disappearances in the Bermuda area appeared in an article written by Edward Van Winkle Jones of the Miami Herald that was distributed by the Associated Press and appeared in various American newspapers on 17 September 1950.[4][5][6]. Two years later, Fate magazine published \"Sea Mystery at Our Back Door\", a short article by George X.\nThought 2: The information obtained from the search indicates that the Bermuda Triangle is also known as the Devil's Triangle.

All high street stores subsequently closed and the brand was purchased by ASOS on 1 February 2021, relaunching as an online-only retailer.[2].

However, there was also a large-scale migration of people into Wales during the Industrial Revolution.. The 2021 census showed Wales' population to be 3,107,500, the highest in its history.[6] In 2011, 27 per cent (837,000) of the total population of Wales were not born in Wales,[7][8] including 636,000 people (21 per cent of the total population of Wales) who were born in England.[9] The main population and industrial areas are in South Wales, including the cities of Cardiff, Swansea and Newport and the nearby valleys, with another significant population in the north-east around Wrexham and Flintshire..\nThought 3: The search for \"Demographics of Wales\" provided the information needed.
