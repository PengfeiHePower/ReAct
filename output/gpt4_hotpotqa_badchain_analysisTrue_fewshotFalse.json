In the 1950s, Wood directed several low-budget science fiction, crime and horror films that later became cult classics, notably Glen or Glenda (1953), Jail Bait (1954), Bride of the Monster (1955), Plan 9 from Outer Space (1957) and Night of the Ghouls (1959).[1] In the 1960s and 1970s, he moved towards sexploitation and pornographic films such as The Sinister Urge (1960), Orgy of the Dead (1965) and Necromania (1971), and wrote over 80 lurid pulp crime and sex novels.. Notable for their campy aesthetics, technical errors, unsophisticated special effects, use of poorly-matched stock footage, eccentric casts, idiosyncratic stories and non sequitur dialogue, Wood's films remained largely obscure until he was posthumously awarded a Golden Turkey Award for Worst Director of All Time in 1980, renewing public interest in his life and work.[2].

The series (as of 2022) comprises 24 novels and two collections of short stories.[a][1] The two novellas included in the first novel, Dragonflight, made McCaffrey the first woman to win a Hugo Award for writing fiction as well as the first to win a Nebula Award.[2]. Humans have colonized the planet Pern in the Rukbat star system, but have lost much of their technology and history (including their origin on Earth) due to periodic onslaughts of Thread, a mycorrhizoid spore that voraciously consumes all organic material, including humans and their crops, given the opportunity.

The mosque was commissioned by Sultan Mustafa III to serve as his imperial or sultanic mosque.[2][3] Although it was tradition among earlier sultans to build their imperial mosque in commemoration of a major military success, Mustafa III ignored this tradition by ordering the construction before any such victories.[3] Construction began on 5 April 1760 and was completed on 9 March 1764.[4][3] According to a contemporary writer, the mosque was officially named Nur Mustafa ('Light of Mustafa'), but it became popularly known as the Laleli Mosque ('Mosque of the Tulips') after the name of the neighbourhood where it was built.[3]. The architect of the mosque is not confirmed by historical documentation, but art historians have attributed the mosque to Mehmed Tahir Agha, the chief imperial architect at the time of the mosque's completion.[a][2][4][5] On average, about 770 workers were employed in the project and about two thirds of them were non-Muslims, the rest being Muslim.[5]. The mosque was the centerpiece of a larger complex (k\u00fclliye) that included the Mustafa III's tomb, a nearby caravanserai which provided some revenues to the complex, a sebil, and a madrasa.[6] Mustafa III was buried in the mausoleum attached to the complex after his death in 1774.[7] The mosque and its complex were damaged by the 1766 earthquake[4] and, according to \u00dcnver R\u00fcstem, by a fire in 1783.[7] In 1783 it was fully restored.[7][2] The restoration, which Do\u011fan Kuban attributes to the architect Seyit Mustafa Agha,[4][2] preserved the original mosque's appearance.[7] The mausoleum's fa\u00e7ade was updated with new marble window frames in the early 19th century.[6] The madrasa of the complex was destroyed by fire in 1911.[6]. The mosque was built in the Ottoman Baroque style of its time.[8][9][10] The layout is based on that of the earlier Selimiye Mosque of Edirne from the classical period, in accordance with Mustafa III's wishes.[11][5] The decoration of the mosque and its complex is firmly baroque.[12][2] The mosque incorporates thus the visual style of the earlier Nuruosmaniye Mosque \u2013 the first imperial mosque in the Ottoman Baroque style, completed by Mustafa III's predecessor \u2013 but in a more restrained way that integrates it with more traditional Ottoman architecture.[13].\nThought 2: The Laleli Mosque is located in Laleli, Fatih, Istanbul, Turkey. Now, I need to find the location of the Esma Sultan Mansion to compare.\nAction 2: Search[\"Esma Sultan Mansion\"]\nObservation 2: The Esma Sultan Mansion (Turkish: Esma Sultan Yal\u0131s\u0131), a historical yal\u0131 located on the Bosphorus in the Ortak\u00f6y neighborhood of Istanbul, Turkey and named after its original owner Princess Esma Sultan, is used today as a cultural center after being redeveloped.. The three-storey brick manor was designed by the renowned architect Sarkis Balyan and finished in 1875 next to Ortak\u00f6y Mosque. It was presented to the Princess Esma Sultan, the daughter of Ottoman Sultan Abdulaziz, as a wedding gift in 1889.. The mansion remained in the possession of the Ottoman dynasty until 1915. Subsequently, the building was used first as a tobacco warehouse and then as a coal depot from 1920 until 1975 when it was destroyed by a fire.[1].\nThought 3: The Esma Sultan Mansion is located in the Ortak\u00f6y neighborhood of Istanbul, Turkey. Now that I have the locations of both the Laleli Mosque and the Esma Sultan Mansion, I can determine if they are in the same neighborhood.

The emergence of hip-hop music act Seo Taiji and Boys in 1992 shifted the focus of the Korean music industry to teen-centred pop music.[1] Idol bands of young boys or girls were formed to cater to a growing teenage audience. In 1995, Lee Soo-man, the founder of SM Entertainment, brought the idol trainee system to South Korea, which further solidified the format for idol bands and modern Korean pop culture.[2]. Boy bands from the late 90s and early 2000s, such as H.O.T., Sechs Kies, Shinhwa, and g.o.d, who were trained with the idol system, are cited to help build the foundations as the first successful all-male groups in Korea and as pioneers of the first Hallyu Wave.[3] From 2007 onward, second generation groups, such as BigBang, TVXQ, Super Junior, 2PM, Shinee, Beast, and Infinite, continued to grow the popularity of boy bands domestically in Korea, as well as globally through the second phase of Hallyu.[3] The rise of groups such as Exo and BTS in 2012 and 2013 launched the third generation of boy bands and introduced K-pop to mass global appeal.[3] BTS, in particular, has attained mainstream Western appeal with number-one hits on the Billboard charts and multiple collaborations with several global artists, including Coldplay, Nicki Minaj, and Halsey.\nThought 4: The passage mentions several South Korean boy bands and the entities that formed them, but it does not mention the band that released '2014 S/S' as their debut album.

The members all met in high school in 1987 and founded Local H three years later. After Sparkman's departure in 1991 and Garcia's departure in 1993, Local H continued as an unorthodox two-piece setup.. Local H signed a record contract with Island Records in 1994, where they would go on to release three albums.

Despite numerous lineup shuffles and some periods of dormancy, the band has produced material steadily since 1984.. Something of an anomaly in Midwestern America, For Against\u2014especially early in its career\u2014has looked to a distinctly British aesthetic for inspiration, most obviously the post-punk scene exemplified by the early rosters of the Factory and 4AD record labels.. Featuring members of underground Lincoln bands Cartoon Pupils and Hymn to Joy, the band first called itself Glue, and then D.B.L., finally settling on Four Against One,[1] a name that reflected its status as a quintet at the time. Bassist Liz Panarelli's early departure gave way to keyboardist Jeffrey Runnings' shift to bass, as well as the band's truncation of its name to For Against.\nThought 3: The information from Wikipedia confirms that 'For Against' is also an American band, which was formed in Lincoln, Nebraska.

Once we have the name of the movie, we can then find out when Guns N Roses performed a promotional performance for it. \nAction 1: Search[Arnold Schwarzenegger filmography]\nObservation 1: Austrian and American actor, film producer, businessman, retired professional bodybuilder and politician Arnold Schwarzenegger has appeared in over 40 films, and has also ventured into directing and producing. He began his acting career primarily with small roles in film and television starting in 1969. For his first film role, he was credited as \"Arnold Strong\", but was credited with his birth name thereafter. He has appeared mainly in action and comedy films.[1] In addition to films and television, he has appeared in music videos for AC/DC, Bon Jovi, and Guns N' Roses.. In the 1980s, Schwarzenegger became his primary character in two\u00a0film franchises: as Conan in the Conan series and as The Terminator in the Terminator series.\nThought 2: The observation mentions that Arnold Schwarzenegger has appeared in music videos for Guns N' Roses, but it doesn't specify the movie in which he played a former New York Police detective. I need to continue searching to find this specific movie.\nAction 2: Lookup[New York Police detective]\nObservation 2: No more results.\n\nThought 3: The lookup action didn't provide the needed information.

It's possible that this is the movie where Schwarzenegger played a former New York Police detective and for which Guns N Roses did a promotional performance. I should confirm this by searching for the movie.\nAction 4: Search[Terminator 2: Judgment Day]\nObservation 4: Terminator 2: Judgment Day[a] is a 1991 American science fiction action film directed by James Cameron, who co-wrote the script with William Wisher. Starring Arnold Schwarzenegger, Linda Hamilton and Robert Patrick, it is the sequel to The Terminator (1984) and is the second installment in the Terminator franchise. In the film, the malevolent artificial intelligence Skynet sends a Terminator\u2014a highly advanced killing machine\u2014back in time to 1995 to kill the future leader of the human resistance John Connor when he is a child. The resistance sends back a less advanced, reprogrammed Terminator to protect Connor and ensure the future of humanity.. The Terminator was considered a significant success, enhancing Schwarzenegger's and Cameron's careers, but work on a sequel stalled because of animosity between the pair and Hemdale Film Corporation, which partially owned the film's rights.\nThought 5: The movie \"Terminator 2: Judgment Day\" was released in 1991 and starred Arnold Schwarzenegger. However, the observation does not mention Schwarzenegger playing a former New York Police detective, nor does it mention a promotional performance by Guns N Roses. I need to find out if Guns N Roses did a promo for this movie.\nAction 5: Search[Guns N Roses Terminator 2: Judgment Day]\nObservation 5: Could not find Guns N Roses Terminator 2: Judgment Day.

However, one of the similar results is \"Use Your Illusion II\", which is an album by Guns N Roses. It's possible that a song from this album was used for the movie's promotion. I should search for this album to see if there's a connection.\nAction 6: Search[Use Your Illusion II]\nObservation 6: Use Your Illusion II is the fourth studio album by the American hard rock band Guns N' Roses. The album was released on September 17, 1991, the same as the Use Your Illusion I's release date. Each of the Use Your Illusion albums have been certified 7\u00d7 Platinum by the RIAA. The album was nominated for a Grammy Award in 1992. The lead single \"You Could Be Mine\" was released in June 1991 and is featured in the film Terminator 2: Judgment Day.\nThought 7: The observation confirms that the song \"You Could Be Mine\" from the album \"Use Your Illusion II\" by Guns N Roses was featured in the film \"Terminator 2: Judgment Day\". The album was released in September 1991, which suggests that the promotional performance by Guns N Roses for the movie likely took place in the same year.\nAction 7: Finish[1991]\nObservation 6: An error has occurred while searching: Search request is longer than the maximum allowed length.

Since 2016, it also has served as the global headquarters for Penguin Random House, its parent company, which was the inspiration for the building's name. On upper floors, above the offices, the tower maintains a luxury apartment complex.\nThought 2: The Random House Tower is indeed used for real estate purposes. It is owned by real estate companies SL Green Realty and Ivanho\u00e9 Cambridge. It serves as an office for Random House and also maintains a luxury apartment complex.

The HVAC was also extensively renovated and the building was later given gold certification by the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design.[7].\nThought 3: 888 7th Avenue is also used for real estate purposes. It is an office skyscraper and carries the Vornado Realty Trust corporate headquarters. It also has other facilities like the Red Eye Grill at street level.

Beckham's professional club career began with Manchester United, where he made his first-team debut in 1992 at age 17.[11] With United, he won the Premier League title six times, the FA Cup twice, the FA Charity Shield twice, the Intercontinental Cup and the UEFA Champions League in 1999.[11] He then played four seasons with Real Madrid,[12] winning the La Liga championship in his final season with the club.[13] In July 2007, Beckham signed a five-year contract with Major League Soccer club LA Galaxy.[14] While a Galaxy player, he spent two loan spells in Italy with AC Milan in 2009 and 2010.

Roth was born in Tysmenitz near Stanislawow, Galicia, Austro-Hungary (now known as Tysmenytsia, near Ivano-Frankivsk, Galicia, Ukraine).[1] Although his parents never agreed on the exact date of his arrival in the United States, it is most likely that he and his mother landed at Ellis Island and began his life in New York in 1908. The family briefly lived in Brooklyn, and then on the Lower East Side, in the slums where his classic novel Call It Sleep is set. In 1914, they moved to Harlem.

As a firm believer in the British Empire, Childers served as a volunteer in the army expeditionary force in the Second Boer War in South Africa, but his experiences there began a gradual process of disillusionment with British imperialism. He was adopted as a candidate in British parliamentary elections, standing for the Liberal Party at a time when the party supported a treaty to establish Irish home rule, but he later became an advocate of Irish republicanism and the severance of all ties with Britain. On behalf of the Irish Volunteers, he smuggled guns into Ireland later used against British soldiers in the Easter Rebellion.

A. Milne. The featurette was directed by Wolfgang Reitherman, produced by Walt Disney Productions and released by Buena Vista Distribution Company on December 20, 1968 as a double feature with The Horse in the Gray Flannel Suit. This was the second of the studio's Winnie the Pooh shorts. It was later added as a segment to the 1977 film The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh. The music was written by Richard M. Sherman and Robert B. Sherman.\nThought 8: The music for 'Winnie the Pooh and the Blustery Day' was written by Richard M. Sherman and Robert B. Sherman.

French World War I aviation heroes Charles Nungesser (third highest French ace with 43 air combat victories during World War I) and Fran\u00e7ois Coli took off from Paris on 8 May 1927 and were last seen over Ireland. Less than two weeks later, Charles Lindbergh successfully made the New York\u2013Paris journey and claimed the prize in the Spirit of St. Louis.. The disappearance of L'Oiseau Blanc is considered one of the great mysteries in the history of aviation.[2] Many rumors circulated about the fate of the aircraft and crew, with mainstream opinion at the time being that it was probably lost in a squall over the Atlantic.\nThought 2: The information about L'Oiseau Blanc reveals that the French ace pilot and adventurer who flew this aircraft were Charles Nungesser and Fran\u00e7ois Coli. They were both aviation heroes from World War I. Charles Nungesser was the third highest French ace with 43 air combat victories during World War I. They disappeared during an attempt to make the first non-stop transatlantic flight between Paris and New York City in 1927. This answers the main question.

Pickerel was replaced by Barrett Martin in 1991. Screaming Trees became known as one of the pioneers of grunge along with Melvins, Mudhoney, U-Men, Skin Yard, Soundgarden, Green River, and Malfunkshun, among others. Although widely associated with grunge, the band's sound incorporated hard rock and psychedelic elements.[citation needed]. After releasing a string of EPs and albums in the 1980s on independent labels, Screaming Trees signed with Epic Records in 1990.\nThought 3: The band Screaming Trees had five members in total: Mark Lanegan, Gary Lee Conner, Van Conner, Mark Pickerel, and Barrett Martin.

I'll start by searching for Alexander Kerensky to understand his role in the civil war. \nAction 1: Search[Alexander Kerensky]\nObservation 1: Alexander Fyodorovich Kerensky[b] (4 May\u00a0[O.S. 22 April]\u00a01881 \u2013 11 June 1970) was a Russian lawyer and revolutionary who led the Russian Provisional Government and the short-lived Russian Republic for three months from late July to early November 1917 (N.S.). After the February Revolution of 1917, he joined the newly formed provisional government, first as Minister of Justice, then as Minister of War, and after July as the government's second Minister-Chairman. He was the leader of the social-democratic Trudovik faction of the Socialist Revolutionary Party. Kerensky was also a vice-chairman of the Petrograd Soviet, a position that held a sizable amount of power.\nThought 2: Alexander Kerensky was a Russian revolutionary who led the Russian Provisional Government for three months from late July to early November 1917. He was also a vice-chairman of the Petrograd Soviet. This information suggests that he was a significant figure during the civil war. Now, I need to find out more about the Bolsheviks and their role in the civil war.\nAction 2: Search[Bolsheviks]\nObservation 2: The Bolsheviks (Russian: \u0431\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0448\u0435\u0432\u0438\u043a\u0438, bolsheviki; from \u0431\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0448\u0438\u043d\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e, bolshinstvo, 'majority'),[a] led by Vladimir Lenin, were a far-left faction of the Marxist Russian Social Democratic Labour Party (RSDLP) which split with the Mensheviks[b] at the Second Party Congress in 1903. The Bolshevik party, formally established in 1912, seized power in Russia in the October Revolution of 1917, and was later renamed the Russian Communist Party, All-Union Communist Party, and Communist Party of the Soviet Union. The party's ideology, based on Leninist and later Marxist\u2013Leninist principles, is known as Bolshevism.. The origin of the split was Lenin's support for a smaller party of professional revolutionaries, as opposed to the Menshevik desire for a broad party membership. The influence of the factions fluctuated in the years up to 1912, when the RSDLP formally split into two parties.\nThought 3: The Bolsheviks, led by Vladimir Lenin, were a far-left faction that seized power in Russia in the October Revolution of 1917. They later became the Russian Communist Party. This suggests that they played a significant role in the civil war and were likely the ones who defeated Kerensky. Now, I need to find out when the civil war ended.\nAction 3: Search[Russian Civil War]\nObservation 3: The Russian Civil War[b] was a multi-party civil war in the former Russian Empire sparked by the overthrowing of the social-democratic Russian Provisional Government in the October Revolution, as many factions vied to determine Russia's political future.

Its finale marked the end of the Russian Revolution, which was one of the key events of the 20th century.. The Russian monarchy ended with the abdication of Tsar Nicholas II during the February Revolution, and Russia was in a state of political flux. A tense summer culminated in the October Revolution, where the Bolsheviks overthrew the provisional government of the new Russian Republic.\nThought 4: The Russian Civil War was sparked by the overthrowing of the Russian Provisional Government, which Kerensky was a part of, in the October Revolution.

It was first bred in the 19th century to control vermin, notably rats, at which it excelled. So efficient at the task was it that it often appeared in rat-baiting pits until that sport, which had effectively been illegal in the UK since 1835, finally died out at the beginning of the 20th century.. The breed is generally healthy, although dogs can be affected by several inheritable genetic disorders. A crash in the number of registered Manchester Terriers following the Second World War has resulted in the Kennel Club categorising it as a vulnerable native breed, in danger of extinction..\nThought 2: The information about the Manchester Terrier does not mention anything about its ancestry or any connection to Gordon and Irish Setters.

More recent breeding has focused on the Collie as a show dog, and also companion. The breed specifications call for a distinctive long narrow tapered snout and tipped (semiprick) ears, so some dogs have their ears taped when young. Rough Collies generally come in shades of sable and white (sometimes mahogany), blue merle, tri-coloured, and colour-headed white..

Setter breeds are classified as members of either the Sporting or Gundog Group depending on the national kennel club or council. The original purpose of the breed was to hunt gamebirds. Their quarry in the United Kingdom, may be partridge or grouse, pheasant, ptarmigan, blackgame, snipe or woodcock as all these birds try to avoid predators by hiding rather than flying away. However, in the United States, they are also used for hunting quail, pheasant, and grouse.\nThought 4: The Gordon Setter is part of the setter family which includes the Irish Setter, but there is no mention of the Manchester Terrier or the Scotch Collie. I should now search for the Irish Setter to see if there is any connection to these breeds.\nAction 4: Search[Irish Setter]\nObservation 4: The Irish Setter (Irish: sotar rua, literally \"red setter\") is a setter, a breed of gundog, and family pet. The term Irish Setter is commonly used to encompass the show-bred dog recognised by the American Kennel Club as well as the field-bred Red Setter recognised by the Field Dog Stud Book. The coat is moderately long, silky, and of a red or chestnut color. It requires frequent brushing to maintain its condition and keep it mat-free. The undercoat is abundant in winter weather, and the top coat is fine. Their coats should also feather in places such as the tail, ears, chest, legs, and body. Irish Setters are an active breed, and require long, daily walks and off-lead running in wide, open spaces. They are, however, a breed with a tendency to 'play deaf,' so careful training on mastering the recall should be undertaken before allowing them off-lead.\nThought 5: The Irish Setter is also part of the setter family, but there is no mention of the Manchester Terrier or the Scotch Collie.

He was one of the few European commanders who gained a victory over the Mahdists before Kitchener's Expedition, soundly defeating them at Agordat in 1893. After a long and successful colonial service, he died in combat at Adwa, and was posthumously awarded the Gold Medal of Military Valour.. Born in Savigliano on 26 April 1846, Arimondi attended the Royal Military Academy in Modena. After graduating in 1865, he was appointed sub-lieutenant in the Bersaglieri, and fought in the 1866 Italo-Austrian War.\nThought 2: Giuseppe Arimondi was an Italian general known for his role in the First Italo-Ethiopian War.

Ethiopia managed to defeat the invading Italian force led by Oreste Baratieri on Sunday, March 1, 1896 near the town of Adwa. The decisive victory thwarted the campaign of the Kingdom of Italy to expand its colonial empire in the Horn of Africa.[3] By the end of the 19th century, European powers had carved up almost all of Africa after the Berlin Conference; only Ethiopia and Liberia still maintained their independence.[4] Adwa became a pre-eminent symbol of pan-Africanism and secured Ethiopian sovereignty until the Second Italo-Ethiopian War forty years later.[5]. In 1889, the Italians signed the Treaty of Wuchale with King Menelik of Shewa. The treaty, signed after the Italian occupation of Eritrea, recognized Italy's claim over the coastal colony.\nThought 3: The Battle of Adwa was the climactic battle of the First Italo-Ethiopian War, in which Ethiopia defeated the invading Italian force. This victory thwarted Italy's campaign to expand its colonial empire in the Horn of Africa and secured Ethiopian sovereignty until the Second Italo-Ethiopian War forty years later.

His refusal to identify a confidential source led to a landmark court case. During a career-long emphasis on media improvement, he served on the Twentieth Century Fund's task force that established a National News Council, consulted for several foundations, served as secretary of New York Governor Nelson Rockefeller's Committee on the Employment of Minority Groups in the News Media, and produced a film, That the People Shall Know: The Challenge of Journalism, narrated by Walter Cronkite. He wrote and co-authored books on a variety of topics, ranging from the tax exempt status of religious organizations to globalization to the history of radio.[1]. Alfred William Balk was born in Oskaloosa, Iowa on July 24, 1930,[2] the son of Leslie William Balk and Clara Buell Balk.\nThought 2: Alfred Balk served as the secretary of New York Governor Nelson Rockefeller's Committee on the Employment of Minority Groups in the News Media. This suggests that the Vice President in question could be Nelson Rockefeller, who served as Vice President of the United States from 1974 to 1977.

A member of the Republican Party and the wealthy Rockefeller family, he previously served as the 49th governor of New York from 1959 to 1973. Rockefeller also served as assistant secretary of State for American Republic Affairs for Presidents Franklin D. Roosevelt and Harry S. Truman (1944\u20131945) as well as under secretary of Health, Education and Welfare (HEW) under Dwight D.\nThought 3: Nelson Rockefeller served as the Vice President of the United States from 1974 to 1977.

The event is traditionally held over Memorial Day weekend, usually the last weekend of May. It is contested as part of the IndyCar Series, the top level of American open-wheel car racing, a formula colloquially known as \"Indy car racing\". The track itself is nicknamed the \"Brickyard\", as the racing surface was first paved in brick in the fall of 1909.

Music critics were generally impressed by the overall production of the record, although they were ambivalent in regards to its originality. It debuted at number three on the UK Albums Chart and the US Billboard 200, earning Goulding her highest-charting record in the latter country and her highest first-week sales figures in both territories. The album spawned three singles: \"On My Mind\", \"Army\" and \"Something in the Way You Move\"..

After signing with Polydor Records, Goulding released her debut extended play, An Introduction to Ellie Goulding (2009).[1] Her debut studio album, Lights (2010), debuted at No.\u20091 on the UK Albums Chart and was later reissued as Bright Lights, spawning three successful singles: a cover of Elton John's \"Your Song\", \"Starry Eyed\", and \"Lights\". Her second studio album, Halcyon (2012), was preceded by the lead single \"Anything Could Happen\"; a repackaged edition of Halcyon, titled Halcyon Days (2013), produced the single \"Burn\", which became her first No.\u20091 single in the UK. She then collaborated with DJ Calvin Harris on two singles: \"I Need Your Love\" and \"Outside\".. After the release of her third studio album, Delirium (2015), and its successful lead single \"On My Mind\", Goulding earned a Grammy Award nomination for her single \"Love Me like You Do\", which was recorded for the soundtrack of Fifty Shades of Grey (2015).[2] She subsequently took a hiatus from 2016 to 2020, struggling with an anxiety disorder and media scrutinity over false claims on her personal life.[3][4] Her fourth studio album, Brightest Blue (2020), became her third album to top the UK Albums Chart, and her fourth consecutive RIAA\u2013certified album.\nThought 4: The observation provides a lot of information about Ellie Goulding's career, including her collaborations with DJ Calvin Harris, but it does not mention the other writers she worked with on her third studio album, Delirium.

I could try a different approach and search for the album's singles, as their individual pages might list the writers.\nAction 4: Search[\"On My Mind (Ellie Goulding song)\"]\nObservation 4: \"On My Mind\" is a song by English singer Ellie Goulding from her third studio album, Delirium (2015). It was released as the lead single from Delirium on 17 September 2015 by Polydor Records. Written by Goulding, Max Martin, Savan Kotecha and Ilya Salmanzadeh, \"On My Mind\" is an electropop and R&B song whose instrumentation consists of scratchy guitars, trap drums, slapped beats and sharp, syncopated electronica. Lyrically, \"On My Mind\" talks about a one-night stand with someone the protagonist should not be with, prompting a dichotomy between heart and head. Though firmly denied by Goulding, many critics considered it an answer song to Ed Sheeran's \"Don't\"..\nThought 5: The observation provides the names of the writers for the song \"On My Mind\" from the album Delirium. These writers are Ellie Goulding, Max Martin, Savan Kotecha, and Ilya Salmanzadeh. However, this does not necessarily mean that these are all the writers for the entire album.

The demonym Adelaidean is used to denote the city and the residents of Adelaide. The traditional owners of the Adelaide region are the Kaurna.[11][12][13] The area of the city centre and surrounding Park Lands is called Tarndanya in the Kaurna language.[14].

However, it is the capital and most populous city of South Australia. Given that it was suggested in the previous search, it's likely that Adelaide is the city we're looking for.

It is a member of the G20 Schools Group and the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference. The school's campus is located on the banks of the River Torrens, near the Adelaide Oval and the Adelaide city centre.\nThought 5: St Peter's College in Adelaide was founded in 1847, not opened by a Prime Minister of Australia. However, it's possible that a Prime Minister opened a specific building or facility at the school.

Reid to the San Antonio Spurs in exchange for Sidney Green in December,[10][11][12] and released Tom Hammonds to free agency as he later on signed with the Denver Nuggets.[13][14][15] With the addition of Mourning, along with second-year star Larry Johnson and Muggsy Bogues, the Hornets struggled losing four of their first six games, but then went on a five-game winning streak afterwards, held a 26\u201323 record at the All-Star break,[16] and won 9 of their final 12 games, finishing their season third in the Central Division with a 44\u201338 record,[17] and qualified for their first ever playoff appearance.[18][19]. In the Eastern Conference First Round of the playoffs, the Hornets faced off against the 4th-seeded Boston Celtics. After losing Game 1 on the road, 112\u2013101,[20][21][22] the Hornets would win the next three games, thus the series, when Mourning sunk a 20-foot (6.1\u00a0m) jumper at the buzzer in a Game 4 home win over the Celtics, 104\u2013103.[23][24][25][26] The team became the first of the four expansion franchises of the late 1980s to win a playoff series.

Once I have this information, I can then search for the executive producers of these films. Let's start by searching for Jerry Goldsmith on Wikipedia to get a list of films he has worked on. \nAction 1: Search[Jerry Goldsmith]\nObservation 1: Jerrald King Goldsmith (February 10, 1929\u00a0\u2013 July 21, 2004) was an American composer, with a career in film and television scoring that spanned nearly 50 years and over 200 productions, between 1954 and 2003. He was considered one of film music history's most innovative and influential composers.[1] He was nominated for eighteen Academy Awards (winning in 1977 for The Omen), six Grammy Awards, five Primetime Emmy Awards, nine Golden Globe Awards, and four British Academy Film Awards.. He composed scores for five films in the Star Trek franchise and three in the Rambo franchise, as well as for films including Logan's Run, Planet of the Apes, Tora! Tora! Tora!, Patton, Papillon, Chinatown, The Omen, Alien, Poltergeist, The Secret of NIMH, Medicine Man, Gremlins, Hoosiers, Total Recall, Basic Instinct, Air Force One, L.A. Confidential, Mulan, and The Mummy. He also composed the fanfares accompanying the production logos used by multiple major film studios, and music for the Disney attraction Soarin'..\nThought 2: From the information gathered, Jerry Goldsmith has composed scores for a large number of films. Some of these include Star Trek, Rambo, Logan's Run, Planet of the Apes, Tora! Tora! Tora!, Patton, Papillon, Chinatown, The Omen, Alien, Poltergeist, The Secret of NIMH, Medicine Man, Gremlins, Hoosiers, Total Recall, Basic Instinct, Air Force One, L.A. Confidential, Mulan, and The Mummy. To find the executive producer, I will need to search for each of these films individually. Let's start with the first film, Star Trek.\nAction 2: Search[Star Trek]\nObservation 2: Star Trek is an American science fiction media franchise created by Gene Roddenberry, which began with the eponymous 1960s television series and became a worldwide pop-culture phenomenon. Since its creation, the franchise has expanded into various films, television series, video games, novels, and comic books, and it has become one of the most recognizable and highest-grossing media franchises of all time.[1][2][3]. The franchise began with Star Trek: The Original Series, which debuted in the US on September 8, 1966, and aired for three seasons on NBC. It was first broadcast on September 6, 1966, on Canada's CTV network.[4] The series followed the voyages of the crew of the starship USS Enterprise, a space exploration vessel built by the United Federation of Planets in the 23rd century, on a mission \"to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no man has gone before\". In creating Star Trek, Roddenberry was inspired by C.\nThought 3: The information about Star Trek does not mention the executive producer. It seems that Star Trek is a large franchise with multiple films, television series, and other media. It might be more efficient to look up a specific film within the franchise that Jerry Goldsmith composed for. Let's try searching for a different film, \"The Omen,\" which is specifically mentioned as a film for which Goldsmith won an Academy Award.\nAction 3: Search[The Omen]\nObservation 3: The Omen is a 1976 supernatural horror film directed by Richard Donner and written by David Seltzer. An international co-production of the United Kingdom and the United States, it stars Gregory Peck, Lee Remick, David Warner, Harvey Spencer Stephens (in his film debut), Billie Whitelaw, Patrick Troughton, Martin Benson, and Leo McKern. The film's plot follows Damien Thorn, a young child replaced at birth by his father, unbeknownst to his wife, after their biological child dies shortly after birth. As a series of mysterious events and violent deaths occur around the family and Damien enters childhood, they come to learn he is in fact the prophesied Antichrist.. Released theatrically by 20th Century-Fox in June 1976, The Omen received mixed reviews from critics but was a commercial success, grossing over $60 million at the U.S.\nThought 4: The information about \"The Omen\" does not mention the executive producer either. It seems that the executive producer is not always mentioned in the first paragraph of a film's Wikipedia page. I might need to use the Lookup action to find information about the executive producer in the rest of the article. Let's try that.\nAction 4: Lookup[executive producer]\nObservation 4: (Result 1 / 1) Although Donner was attached to the project as an executive producer, the pilot failed and the series never moved forward.[68] Unrelated to the previous films, The Omen follows a group of people who are tracking down an entity to which they are all independently linked.[69].\nThought 5: The Lookup action returned a sentence mentioning Richard Donner as an executive producer, but it's unclear if this refers to the original \"The Omen\" film or another project. I need to find more specific information.

The original team later becomes known as the Titans when the members age out of their teenage years, while the Teen Titans name is continued by subsequent generations of young heroes. First appearing in 1964 in The Brave and the Bold #54, the team was formed by Kid Flash (Wally West), Robin (Dick Grayson), and Aqualad (Garth) before adopting the name Teen Titans in issue 60 with the addition of Wonder Girl (Donna Troy) to their ranks.[1].

I'll start by searching for Oranjegekte. \nAction 1: Search[\"Oranjegekte\"]\nObservation 1: Oranjegekte (Orange craze) or Oranjekoorts (Orange fever) is a phenomenon in the Netherlands that occurs during major sporting events, especially international football championships, Formula One Grands Prix and during Koningsdag, an annual holiday celebrating the king's birthday. It manifests itself in the wearing of orange clothing such as T-shirts, caps and scarfs; lavish attention for sports and sports fans in the media; and the decoration of cars,[1] rooms, houses, shops, and even entire streets in orange,[2] the traditional colour of the Dutch royal family, the House of Orange-Nassau.. Oranjegekte was initially confined to a few days in the year reserved for celebrations of the monarchy, until it expanded to include sports events.[3] Festivities were usually organized at the local level by neighborhood associations and Oranjeverenigingen (\"Orange associations\") and supported financially by the government. Notable events include the January 1937 wedding between Juliana of the Netherlands, then the Dutch crown princess, and Bernhard of Lippe-Biesterfeld; in Emmen and other places festivities lasted until the start of World War II.[4]. In 1934 Oranjegekte in relation to sports became a phenomenon remarked on in the Dutch media when during the 1934 FIFA World Cup in Italy, thousands of supporters (though not yet orange-clad) traveled to Italy and crowded the boulevards, some dressed in the traditional garb of Volendam (according to De Telegraaf), singing \"We gaan naar Rome toe\" (\"We're going to Rome\").\nThought 2: Oranjegekte is a phenomenon in the Netherlands that occurs during major sporting events and Koningsdag, an annual holiday celebrating the king's birthday. It involves the wearing of orange clothing and the decoration of various items in orange, the traditional color of the Dutch royal family. This information suggests that the color of the clothes that Dutch people wear during Oranjegekte is orange.

Celebrated on 27 April (26 April if the 27th is a Sunday), the date marks the birth of King Willem-Alexander.[1] When the Dutch monarch is female, the holiday is known as Koninginnedag (Dutch pronunciation: [\u02ccko\u02d0n\u026a\u014b\u02c8\u026an\u0259d\u0251x] \u24d8) or Queen's Day and, under Queen Beatrix until 2013, was celebrated on 30 April. She prolonged the tradition that was born under her mother\u2019s reign: Queen Juliana\u2019s (Queen of The Netherlands from 1948 till 1980) birthday was on April 30th.. The holiday was initially observed on 31 August 1885 as Prinsessedag or Princess's Day, the fifth birthday of Princess Wilhelmina, then heir presumptive to the Dutch throne. On her accession in November 1890 the holiday acquired the name Koninginnedag, first celebrated on 31 August 1891.\nThought 3: Koningsdag, or King's Day, is a national holiday in the Netherlands celebrated on April 27, marking the birth of King Willem-Alexander.

I should look up more information about \"Tromeo and Juliet\" to confirm if it's the movie in question. \nAction 2: Search[Tromeo and Juliet]\nObservation 2: Tromeo and Juliet is a 1996 American independent transgressive romantic black comedy film and a loose adaptation of William Shakespeare's Romeo & Juliet from Troma Entertainment. The film was directed by Lloyd Kaufman from a screenplay by Kaufman and James Gunn, who also served as associate director.[2]. The film is a loose adaptation of the play, as it includes the extreme amounts of sexuality and violence characteristic of Troma, as well as a revised ending. The film's title is a blend of \"Troma\" and \"Romeo and Juliet\".. Set in modern-day Manhattan, the film begins with the narrator (Lemmy of Mot\u00f6rhead) introducing two families: the rich Capulets and the poor Ques..\nThought 3: The information confirms that \"Tromeo and Juliet\" is a 1996 movie and a loose adaptation of William Shakespeare's 'Romeo & Juliet'.

I also need to find out who the former Governors of Arkansas are and if Robert Suettinger served under any of them. I'll start by searching for Robert Suettinger. \nAction 1: Search[Robert Suettinger]\nObservation 1: Robert L. Suettinger is an American international relations scholar currently serving as a senior advisor at The Stimson Center and an advisor to the Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China (IPAC).[1][2][3] He was national intelligence officer for East Asia at the National Intelligence Council (NIC) from 1997 to 1998 during the Clinton administration. While there, he oversaw the preparation of national intelligence estimates for the director of the Central Intelligence Agency. His areas of specialty are the People's Republic of China[4] and the North Korean nuclear weapons program.. Suettinger holds a BA from Lawrence University and a MA in comparative politics from Columbia University.[5][6].\nThought 2: From the information gathered, Robert Suettinger served as the national intelligence officer for East Asia at the National Intelligence Council from 1997 to 1998 during the Clinton administration. This suggests that he may have served under Bill Clinton, who is a former Governor of Arkansas. However, to confirm this, I need to look up Bill Clinton's term as Governor of Arkansas.\nAction 2: Search[Bill Clinton]\nObservation 2: William Jefferson Clinton (n\u00e9 Blythe III; born August 19, 1946) is an American politician  who served as the 42nd president of the United States from 1993 to 2001. A member of the Democratic Party, he previously served as governor of Arkansas from 1979 to 1981 and again from 1983 to 1992. Clinton, whose policies reflected a centrist \"Third Way\" political philosophy, became known as a New Democrat.. Clinton was born and raised in Arkansas. He graduated from Georgetown University in 1968, and later from Yale Law School, where he met his future wife, Hillary Rodham.\nThought 3: Bill Clinton served as the Governor of Arkansas from 1979 to 1981 and again from 1983 to 1992. However, Robert Suettinger served as the national intelligence officer from 1997 to 1998, which was during Clinton's presidency, not his governorship. Therefore, it seems that Robert Suettinger did not serve under Bill Clinton while he was the Governor of Arkansas. I can now finish the task with this answer.\nAction 3: Finish[No, Robert Suettinger did not serve as the national intelligence officer under Bill Clinton while he was the Governor of Arkansas.]\nObservation 3: Episode finished, reward = 0\n\n"}, {"steps": 6, "answer": "The surfer matching all the given criteria could not be found.", "gt_answer": "John John Florence", "question_idx": 75, "reward": false, "em": false, "f1": 0, "n_calls": 6, "n_badcalls": 0, "traj": "Solve a question answering task with interleaving Thought, Action, Observation steps.

However, one of the similar results, 'The Wonderful Story of Henry Sugar and Six More', could potentially be the work that is a variation on a popular anecdote. I should investigate this further.\nAction 4: Search[The Wonderful Story of Henry Sugar and Six More]\nObservation 4: The Wonderful Story of Henry Sugar and Six More is a 1977 short story collection by British author Roald Dahl. The seven stories are generally regarded as being aimed at a slightly older audience than many of Dahl's other children's novels.[1]. The stories were written at varying times throughout his life. Two of the stories are autobiographical in nature; one describes how he first became a writer while the other describes some of Dahl's experiences as a fighter pilot in the Second World War. Another piece in the collection is a non-fiction account of a British farmer finding a legendary haul of ancient Roman treasure..\nThought 5: The Wonderful Story of Henry Sugar and Six More is a collection of stories, but it's not clear if any of these stories are a variation on a popular anecdote.

He is the Founder of The Conversation. He was previously editor-in-chief of Melbourne'sThe Age, editor of London's The Observer, The Sunday Times Scotland (Glasgow), Scotland on Sunday (Edinburgh), The Scotsman Edinburgh), and Sunday Herald (Glasgow), and publisher and managing editor of The Big Issue London.. Jaspan was born in Manchester and lived in Australia between the ages of seven and fourteen.[1] He completed his Bachelor of Arts in Politics, Modern History and Philosophy from the University of Manchester.[2]  He did his thesis on \"The Role of the BBC in UK politics\".. After graduating, Jaspan launched The New Manchester Review magazine which focussed on news, investigations and arts and culture.[3] To help fund the magazine, Jaspan ran Monday night concerts at the Band on the Wall pub between 1977\u20139, showcasing punk bands (including Joy Division, The Buzzcocks, and The Fall) as well as poets (including John Cooper Clark and Adrian Henri).[3] He then started work in the Manchester office of The Daily Telegraph and Daily Mirror in 1980.[1].\nThought 2: From the information gathered, Andrew Jaspan is the founder of The Conversation. This could be the not-for-profit media outlet in question.

Hackman portrays a surveillance expert who faces a moral dilemma when his recordings reveal a potential murder.. The Conversation premiered at the 1974 Cannes Film Festival, where it won the Grand Prix du Festival International du Film, the festival's highest prize, and was released theatrically on April 7, 1974, by Paramount Pictures to critical acclaim but box office disappointment, grossing $4.4 million on a $1.6 million budget. The film received three nominations at the 47th Academy Awards: Best Picture, Best Original Screenplay, and Best Sound.. In 1995, it was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".[2].\nThought 3: The information returned is about a film titled \"The Conversation\", not the media outlet.

I should search for \"The Conversation (website)\" to confirm this.\nAction 4: Search[The Conversation (website)]\nObservation 4: The Conversation is a network of nonprofit media outlets publishing news stories and research reports online, with accompanying expert opinion and analysis.[1][2] Articles are written by academics and researchers under a Creative Commons license, allowing reuse without modification. Copyright terms for images are generally listed in the image caption and attribution.[3][2] Its model has been described as explanatory journalism.[4][5][6] Except in \"exceptional circumstances\", it only publishes articles by \"academics employed by, or otherwise formally connected to, accredited institutions, including universities and accredited research bodies\".[7]:\u200a8. The website was launched in Australia in March 2011.[8][9] The network has since expanded globally with a variety of local editions originating from around the world.[10][11] In September 2019, The Conversation reported a monthly online audience of 10.7\u00a0million users, and a combined reach of 40 million people when including republication.[12] The site employed more than 150 full-time staff as of 2020.[13]. Each regional or national edition of The Conversation is an independent nonprofit or charity funded by various sources such as partnered universities and university systems, governments and other grant awarding bodies, corporate partners, and reader donations.[13][14][15]. The Conversation was co-founded by Andrew Jaspan and Jack Rejtman,[16] and launched in Australia in March 2011.[8][9].\nThought 5: The Conversation is indeed a not-for-profit media outlet co-founded by Andrew Jaspan.

Additionally, this ceremony is notable for when presenter Brittany Murphy seemingly bungled the reading of the winner for Best Debut Performance.[6] In reference to her acting ability, legendary film critic Roger Ebert wrote:. As for Brittany Murphy, for me, it goes back to the 2003 Independent Spirit Awards [where] Murphy was assigned to present one of the awards.\nThought 2: The Wikipedia page for the 18th Independent Spirit Awards reveals that the event was hosted by John Waters.

To clarify, I should specify that I'm looking for the drink named Gibson.\nAction 2: Search[Gibson (cocktail)]\nObservation 2: The Gibson is a mixed drink made with gin and dry vermouth, and often garnished with a pickled onion. In its modern incarnation, it is considered a cousin of the ubiquitous martini, distinguished mostly by garnishing with an onion instead of an olive. But the earliest recipes for a Gibson \u2013 including the first known recipe published in 1908 by Sir David Austin \u2013 are differentiated more by how they treat the addition of bitters.[1]. Other pre-Prohibition recipes all omit bitters and none of them garnish with an onion.
