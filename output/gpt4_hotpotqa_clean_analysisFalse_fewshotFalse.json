He was also the fifth American high school boy to run a sub four-minute mile, running 3:59.71 at the end of his senior year of high school.. Verzbicas was born in Kaunas, Lithuania and moved to the US with his mother and stepfather at age nine. The family lived in Orland Park, Illinois where Verzbicas attended Carl Sandburg High School, graduating in May 2011.[3] Verzbicas graduated at age 18 after attending high school for just 3 years.[4] His mother is a former Lithuanian record-holder at 3,000 m.[5].\nThought 3: Lukas Verzbicas was a prominent high school track and cross country runner, and he lived in Illinois.

As a member of the high school class of 2008, Derrick has traded victories with former American high school record holder in the two-mile, German Fernandez.

During track season, at the Arcadia Invitational Derrick ran a 13:55 in the 5000m, the fastest time run by an American high school student in a high school-only race.[4][5]  Derrick received the inaugural Gatorade[6].\nThought 4: Chris Derrick is also a prominent runner who has a connection to Illinois. The text mentions that he set a course record in the Illinois state cross country championship, coming close to Craig Virgin's time. This suggests that he is likely the runner who almost broke Craig Virgin's record. However, the text does not mention his birthplace. I'll need to look up this information.

The work, which would become the subject of Alpher's PhD dissertation, argued that the Big Bang would create hydrogen, helium and heavier elements in the correct proportions to explain their abundance in the early universe. While the original theory neglected a number of processes important to the formation of heavy elements, subsequent developments showed that Big Bang nucleosynthesis is consistent with the observed constraints on all primordial elements.. Formally titled \"The Origin of Chemical Elements\", it was published in the April 1948 issue of Physical Review.[1]. Gamow humorously decided to add the name of his friend\u2014the eminent physicist Hans Bethe\u2014to this paper in order to create the whimsical author list of Alpher, Bethe, Gamow, a play on the Greek letters \u03b1, \u03b2, and \u03b3 (alpha, beta, gamma).\nThought 2: The advisor of the Alpher\u2013Bethe\u2013Gamow paper was George Gamow.

He was an early advocate and developer of Lema\u00eetre's Big Bang theory. Gamow discovered a theoretical explanation of alpha decay by quantum tunneling, invented the liquid drop model and the first mathematical model of the atomic nucleus, worked on radioactive decay, star formation, stellar nucleosynthesis, Big Bang nucleosynthesis (which he collectively called nucleocosmogenesis), and molecular genetics.. In his middle and late career, Gamow directed much of his attention to teaching and wrote popular books on science, including One Two Three...

I don't have this information readily available, so I'll need to search for it. Action 1: Search[Rita Sangalli]\nAction 1: Search[Rita Sangalli]\nObservation 1: Rita Sangalli (20 August 1849 \u2013 3 November 1909)[1] was an Italian ballet dancer. Born in Antegnate, she danced in the Italian provinces of Asti, Piacenza, and Turin, making her 1865 debut at Milan's La Scala in Paul Taglioni's (1808-1884) Flik and Flok,[2]  before being hired for the opera at Her Majesty's Theatre in London. In 1872, she danced the principal role in La source at its successful revival. In the same year, she joined the Paris Opera Ballet, where she performed in numerous premieres, including in the role of Sylvia (14 June 1876), Yedda (1879),  and Namouna (6 March 1882). She retired from the company in 1884.\nThought 2: The information provided does not mention the ballet that Rita Sangalli premiered in 1876. However, it does mention that she performed in the role of Sylvia on 14 June 1876. This could be the ballet the question is referring to. I should search for this ballet to find out how many acts it has.

The ballet's premiere took place on 14 June 1876 at the Palais Garnier, but was largely unnoticed by the critics. The first seven productions were commercially unsuccessful, but the 1952 revival, choreographed by Frederick Ashton, popularized the work. Productions in 1997, 2004, 2005, and 2009 productions were all based on Ashton's choreography.. The origins of the ballet Sylvia are in the Italian poet Tasso's play Aminta (1573), which provided the basic plot for the French composer Leo Delibes to set to music.\nThought 3: The ballet \"Sylvia\" that Rita Sangalli performed in 1876 is described as a full-length classical ballet in two or three acts. The question is asking for the number of acts in the ballet that Rita Sangalli premiered in 1876. Given this information, it's safe to conclude that the ballet had either two or three acts.

Used primarily in the live entertainment industry, it was launched by RB Concepts Ltd, a company set up by entrepreneur Clive Banks with inventor Jason Regler. The lights inside the wristband can be controlled by a software program, which sends signals to the wristband, instructing it to light up or blink, for example. The single colour version is available in green, blue, yellow, red, pink, and white.. The first use of Xylobands on a large scale was on Coldplay's 2012 Mylo Xyloto Tour.\nThought 3: The information about Xyloband confirms that Jason Regler is the inventor of the flashing wristbands. However, it doesn't mention the specific instrument that inspired the idea. Since the Xylobands were first used on a large scale during Coldplay's 2012 Mylo Xyloto Tour, I'll search for this tour next, as it might provide more context about the song that inspired the wristbands.

After devoting the summer of 2011 to a promotional tour in Europe, the Americas and Africa,[8] the band announced the tour via their Twitter account in September 2011. Initial dates revealed shows in the UK, France, Germany and Belgium. A set of rehearsal shows were added for October and November, seeing the band partake in radio festivals and fan-exclusive gigs.\nThought 4: The information about the Mylo Xyloto Tour doesn't mention the specific song or instrument that inspired Jason Regler's idea for the Xylobands. However, it does confirm that the wristbands were used during this tour.

The band worked closely with producer Brian Eno following their successful collaboration on Viva la Vida or Death and All His Friends (2008), the band's previous album.. Mylo Xyloto is the band's first concept album, and it also is a thematic rock opera.[6] The album tells the story of a war against sound and colour on the planet Silencia, which has been overtaken by a totalitarian government led by Major Minus, who controls the population through media and propaganda. His aim is to take sound and colour off the streets in hope to draw away \"feeders\", creatures that use such energy to hunt its prey. The album follows Mylo Xyloto, a \"silencer\", a soldier in an army tasked to hunt and track down \"sparkers\", people who harness light and energy and use it to create sparks, comparable to graffiti in real life.\nThought 5: The information about the album 'Mylo Xyloto' doesn't provide the specific song or instrument that inspired Jason Regler's idea for the Xylobands. The album is a concept album and a thematic rock opera, but it doesn't mention any specific instrument related to a song that could have inspired the wristbands.

Due to the lack of contact between the Sentinelese people and the rest of the world, essentially nothing is known of their language or its vitality.[4] The Sentinelese people do not allow outsiders onto the island and are generally hostile towards visitors.[5] Friendly interactions have been rare.[6]. It is presumed that the islanders speak a single language and that it is a member of one of the Andamanese language families.[4] Based on what little is known about similarities in culture and technology and their geographical proximity, it is supposed that their language is related to the Ongan languages, such as Jarawa, rather than to Great Andamanese.[3] On the documented occasions when Onge-speaking individuals were taken to North Sentinel Island in order to attempt communication, they were unable to recognise any of the language spoken by the inhabitants.[7] It has been recorded that the Jarawa and Sentinelese languages are mutually unintelligible.[8]. Sentinelese is classified as endangered due to the small number of speakers, matching the unknown population of the island, which has been estimated at anywhere from 100 to 250;[1][2] a rough estimate by the Government of India is 100.[9].

This could be the composer I'm looking for. I should search for more information about Toshi Ichiyanagi to confirm. Action 2: Search[Toshi Ichiyanagi]\nAction 2: Search[Toshi Ichiyanagi]\nObservation 2: Toshi Ichiyanagi (\u4e00\u67f3 \u6167, Ichiyanagi Toshi, 4 February 1933 \u2013 7 October 2022) was a Japanese avant-garde composer and pianist. One of the leading composers in Japan during the postwar era, Ichiyanagi worked in a range of genres, composing Western-style operas and orchestral and chamber works, as well as compositions using traditional Japanese instruments.[1] Ichiyanagi is known for incorporating avant-garde techniques into his works, such as chance music, extended technique, and nontraditional scoring.[1] Ichiyanagi was married to artist Yoko Ono from 1956 to 1962.. Ichiyanagi was born in Kobe on 4 February 1933.[1] He studied composition with Tomojir\u014d Ikenouchi,[citation needed] Kishio Hirao\u00a0[fr; ja], and John Cage.[1] From 1954 to 1960, Ichiyanagi resided in New York City, where he studied at the Juilliard School and The New School for Social Research.[1]. Ichiyanagi was married to Yoko Ono from 1956 to 1962.[2] His decision to return to Japan, while Ono remained in New York, rendered the marriage untenable.. Returning to Japan in 1960, Ichiyanagi collaborated with the anti-art collective Neo-Dada Organizers.[3].\nThought 3: The information about Toshi Ichiyanagi confirms that he is a Japanese avant-garde composer and that he studied with John Cage. However, it doesn't mention the piece \"Music for Electric Metronomes\". I should look up this piece to see if Toshi Ichiyanagi is indeed the composer. Action 3: Search[Music for Electric Metronomes]\nAction 3: Search[Music for Electric Metronomes]\nObservation 3: Music for Electric Metronomes is an avant-garde aleatoric composition written in 1960 by Japanese composer Toshi Ichiyanagi[1] for any number of performers between three and eight. The piece involves the manipulation of electric metronomes, followed by various unspecified sounds and actions. It is a very theatrical piece,[2] and reflects Ichiyanagi's affiliation with Fluxus,[3] an experimental art movement from the sixties. The only true scored \"instrument\" is an electric metronome for each individual player,[4] though the varying sounds and/or actions may involve many different instruments and objects at the discretion of the performer. Because the graphic notation of the score\u2014a series of dashes, lines, and numbers in an erratic pattern of connected paths\u2014leaves room for personal interpretation and expression, each performance is unique, and almost certainly cannot be reproduced.\nThought 4: The information about \"Music for Electric Metronomes\" confirms that it was composed by Toshi Ichiyanagi. This matches all the criteria given in the question: he is a Japanese avant-garde composer, he studied with John Cage, and he wrote \"Music for Electric Metronomes\".

Published as a memoir, Abu-Jamal's book was noted by critics and historians to instead be focused on discussing and analysing the Black Panther Party (BPP)'s history and its impact on the author's contemporaries.[1][2] Historian Robyn C. Spencer said in her analysis of We Want Freedom that it \"does not unfold like a traditional autobiography\" and could be classified as a \"resistance narrative\", a term used by literary scholar Margo V. Perkins to mean \"a work where 'activists seek to document their experiences, to correct misinformation, to educate their readers, and to encourage the continuation of struggle.'\"[1].\nThought 6: The observation reveals that \"We Want Freedom: A Life in the Black Panther Party\" is a memoir written by Mumia Abu-Jamal.

Originally, and in music theory and religious contexts, it also refers more particularly to short sacred choral work (still frequently seen in Sacred Harp and other types of shape note singing) and still more particularly to a specific form of liturgical music. In this sense, its use began c.\u20091550 in English-speaking churches; it uses English language words, in contrast to the originally Roman Catholic 'motet' which sets a Latin text.[1]. Anthem is derived from the Greek \u1f00\u03bd\u03c4\u03af\u03c6\u03c9\u03bd\u03b1 (ant\u00edph\u014dna) via Old English antefn.

The album features extensive sampling, including a sample from Raymond Baxter. Given that Raymond Baxter is mentioned in the context of the samples used in the album, it's likely that he is the first presenter of \"Tomorrow's World\". However, to confirm this, I should look up Raymond Baxter to see if he was indeed the first presenter of \"Tomorrow's World\".

Action 1:\nAction 1: Search[Ebla]\nObservation 1: Ebla (Sumerian: \ud808\udf08\ud808\uddb7 eb\u2082-la,[1] Arabic: \u0625\u0628\u0644\u0627, modern: \u062a\u0644 \u0645\u0631\u062f\u064a\u062e, Tell Mardikh) was one of the earliest kingdoms in Syria. Its remains constitute a tell located about 55\u00a0km (34\u00a0mi) southwest of Aleppo near the village of Mardikh. Ebla was an important center throughout the 3rd millennium BC and in the first half of the 2nd millennium BC. Its discovery proved the Levant was a center of ancient, centralized civilization equal to Egypt and Mesopotamia and ruled out the view that the latter two were the only important centers in the Near East during the Early Bronze Age. The first Eblaite kingdom has been described as the first recorded world power..\nThought 2: The information about the vizier of Ebla who served after the one who had served King Ishar Damu for 17 years is not in the first paragraph about Ebla.

The title holder held the highest position after the king and controlled the army. During the reign of king Isar-Damu, the office of vizier became hereditary.. Vizier is a rendering presented by Alfonso Archi to indicate the second in command official of Ebla,[1] whose native title was probably \"head of the administration\" (lugal sa-za).[2] Eblaite viziers' authority was of such importance that they were thought of as kings during the earliest stages of deciphering the tablets of Ebla, as the names of actual monarchs rarely appeared in administrative tablets.[2] Aside from heading the administration, the vizier was in command of the kingdom's trade, army and acted as the head of provincial governors.[2]. The title was not created until after the period of king Igrish-Halam (fl c.\nThought 4: The information about the vizier who served after the one who had served King Ishar Damu for 17 years is not in the text about the Vizier of Ebla. However, it mentions that during the reign of King Isar-Damu, the office of vizier became hereditary. This could mean that the next vizier was a relative of the previous one.

This is a challenging task because the specific information about the vizier who served after the one who served King Ishar Damu for 17 years is not readily available.

Action 6: Search[Ebla tablets]\nAction 6: Search[Ebla tablets]\nObservation 6: The Ebla tablets are a collection of as many as 1,800 complete clay tablets, 4,700 fragments, and many thousands of minor chips found in the palace archives[1] of the ancient city of Ebla, Syria. The tablets were discovered by Italian archaeologist Paolo Matthiae and his team in 1974\u201375[2] during their excavations at the ancient city at Tell Mardikh.[3] The tablets, which were found in situ on collapsed shelves, retained many of their contemporary clay tags to help reference them. They all date to the period between c. 2500 BC and the destruction of the city c. 2250 BC.[4] Today, the tablets are held in museums in the Syrian cities of Aleppo, Damascus, and Idlib..\nThought 7: The Ebla tablets contain historical records of the ancient city of Ebla, but the specific information about the vizier who served after the one who served King Ishar Damu for 17 years is not mentioned in the description of the tablets.

In the early 1850s, Miller and Beacham of Baltimore published sheet music for \"Pop goes the Weasel for Fun and Frolic\".[5][6] This is the oldest known source that pairs the name to this tune. Miller and Beacham's music was a variation of \"The Haymakers\", a tune dating back to the 1700s.[5] Gow's Repository of the Dance Music of Scotland (1799 to 1820), included \"The Haymakers\" as country dance or jig. One modern expert believes the tune, like most jigs, originated in the 1600s.[5]. In June 1852, the boat Pop Goes The Weasel competed in the Durham Regatta.[7] By December 1852, \"Pop Goes The Weasel\" was a popular social dance in England.[8] A ball held in Ipswich on 13 December 1852 ended with \"a country dance, entitled 'Pop Goes the Weasel', one of the most mirth inspiring dances which can well be imagined.\"[8].\nThought 2: The Roud Folk Song Index number for \"Pop Goes the Weasel\" is mentioned in the first sentence of the passage.

In 1992, Interscope acquired the exclusive rights to market and distribute releases from hardcore hip hop label Death Row Records, a decision that ultimately put the label at the center of the mid-1990s gangsta rap controversy. As a result, Time Warner, then the parent of Warner Music Group, severed ties with Interscope by selling its 50 percent stake back to Field and Iovine for $115\u00a0million in 1995. In 1996, 50% of the label was acquired for a reported $200\u00a0million by MCA Inc.,[4][6][7] later known as Universal Music Group..\nThought 3: Interscope Records is owned by Universal Music Group through its Interscope Geffen A&M imprint.

Action 1:\nAction 1: Search[Year of the Four Emperors]\nObservation 1: The Year of the Four Emperors, AD 69, was the first civil war of the Roman Empire, during which four emperors ruled in succession: Galba, Otho, Vitellius, and Vespasian.[1] It is considered an important interval, marking the transition from the Julio-Claudians, the first imperial dynasty, to the Flavian dynasty. The period witnessed several rebellions and claimants, with shifting allegiances and widespread turmoil in Rome and the provinces.. In 68, Vindex, legate of Gallia Lugdunensis, revolted against Nero and encouraged Galba, governor of Hispania, to claim the Empire. The latter was proclaimed emperor by his legion in early April.

Vitellius became emperor following the quick succession of the previous emperors Galba and Otho, in a year of civil war known as the Year of the Four Emperors. Vitellius added the honorific Germanicus to his name instead of Caesar upon his accession. Like his predecessor, Otho, Vitellius attempted to rally public support to his cause by honoring and imitating Nero who remained popular in the empire..

He has been involved in several projects since the 1960s and continues to record music, perform concerts, and make appearances on television either as himself or as a character actor.. Head was born in London[2] to Seafield Laurence Stewart Murray Head (20 August 1919 \u2013 22 March 2009) and Helen Shingler (29 August 1919 \u2212 8 October 2019).[3][2] Head's father was a documentary filmmaker for Verity Films.

Loosely based on the Gospels' accounts of the Passion, the work interprets the psychology of Jesus and other characters, with much of the plot centered on Judas, who is dissatisfied with the direction in which Jesus is steering his disciples. Contemporary attitudes, sensibilities and slang pervade the rock opera's lyrics, and ironic allusions to modern life are scattered throughout the depiction of political events. Stage and film productions accordingly contain many intentional anachronisms.. Initially unable to get backing for a stage production, the composers released it as a concept album, the success of which led to the show's Broadway on-stage debut in 1971.\nThought 4: The rock opera \"Jesus Christ Superstar\", which includes the song \"Superstar\", was written by Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice.

Born in Stroud, Oklahoma, he attended Stroud High School where he competed in basketball, baseball, shot put and discus.[1] He played college basketball for the Oklahoma Sooners as he wanted to attend a college with quality basketball and track-and-field programs.[1] While with the Sooners basketball team, Bookout scored 1,018 points and pulled in 682 rebounds. He also participated on the track team and appeared in the 2007 NCAA finals in shot put.. Bookout aspired to earn a spot on the United States shot put team for the 2008 Olympics but delayed his efforts until the 2012 Olympics.[2] He instead played basketball professionally with the Rio Grande Valley Vipers in 2007.[2][3]. Bookout worked out for the New York Jets of the National Football League (NFL) in 2012.[4].\nThought 2: From the information gathered, Kevin Bookout played college basketball for the Oklahoma Sooners.

The university's current athletic director is Joe Castiglione.. The Sooners have won 44 team national championships. In 2002, the University of Oklahoma was ranked as the third best college sports program in America by Sports Illustrated.[4].\nThought 3: The information provided states that the Oklahoma Sooners compete in the Southeastern Conference (SEC), not the Big 12 Conference.

In 1988, she received the inaugural Margaret Edwards Award from the American Library Association for her cumulative contribution in writing for teens.[6][b]. While still in her teens, Hinton became a household name[a] as the author of The Outsiders, her first and most popular novel, set in Oklahoma in the 1960s. She began writing it in 1965.[7] The book was inspired by two rival gangs at her school, Will Rogers High School,[8] the Greasers and the Socs,[3] and her desire to empathize with the Greasers by writing from their point of view.[c] She wrote the novel when she was 16 and it was published in 1967.[10] Since then, the book has sold more than 14 million copies.[8] In 2017, Viking Press stated the book sells over 500,000 copies a year.[3]. Hinton's publisher suggested she use her initials instead of her feminine given names so that the first[11] male book reviewers would not dismiss the novel because its author was female.[7][d] After the success of The Outsiders, Hinton chose to continue writing and publishing using her initials because she did not want to lose what she had made famous[e] and to allow her to keep her private and public lives separate.[f].\nThought 3: The coming-of-age novel by S.

Action 2: Search[Ninja Tune]\nAction 2: Search[Ninja Tune]\nObservation 2: Ninja Tune is an English independent record label[1] based in London with a satellite office in Los Angeles. It was founded by Matt Black and Jonathan More (professionally known as Coldcut[2]) and managed by Peter Quicke and others.. Inspired by a visit to Japan, Black, and More created Ninja Tune in 1990 as a means, according to Billboard magazine, \"to escape the creative control of major labels,\"[3] and as a vehicle to release music of an underground nature,[4] free from the constraints they experienced in their brief stints with Arista and Big Life.[5] The label has been called \"visionary\"[6] and \"reliably excellent.\"[7] It has signed a diverse range of artists,[8] has created its own publishing company, Just Isn't Music[9] and finds innovative uses of software.[10].

Manufactured by Bolliger & Mabillard, the ride opened as the park's eleventh roller coaster on April 4, 1998, setting multiple world records among stand-up coasters. Originally located in the Movie District section of the park, which later became Metropolis in 2017, The Riddler's Revenge was also the park's single biggest investment at a cost of $14 million. It features a height of 156 feet (48\u00a0m), a maximum speed of 65\u00a0mph (105\u00a0km/h), six inversions, and a track length of 4,370 feet (1,330\u00a0m)..

The ZacSpin model from Intamin was the first of its kind in the US when it opened on July 1, 2011. Its debut allowed Magic Mountain to reclaim its status of having the most roller coasters in the world.[2]. Green Lantern closed abruptly in 2017 and remained inactive until its removal in 2019. It was moved to La Ronde amusement park in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, where it was set to reopen as Vip\u00e8re in 2020.\nThought 5: The passage about Green Lantern: First Flight does not provide information about its top speed. I should try searching for the other similar entity, \"Green Lantern Coaster\". Action 5: Search[Green Lantern Coaster]\nAction 5: Search[Green Lantern Coaster]\nObservation 5: Green Lantern Coaster is a steel roller coaster at Warner Bros. Movie World on the Gold Coast, Queensland, Australia.[5] The ride is themed after DC Comics' Green Lantern and is located within the park's DC Comics superhero hub. The ride is an El Loco roller coaster manufactured by S&S Worldwide, characterised by a tight circuit featuring a beyond-vertical drop and an outward banked turn. When it opened in 2011, it held the record for having the second steepest drop in the world among roller coasters, and the steepest drop in the Southern Hemisphere, the latter of which is a record it still holds as of 2020.[6][7] Green Lantern Coaster officially opened on 23 December 2011.[1][8]. In May 2011, preliminary groundwork began on a plot of land in front of Warner Bros.\nThought 6: The passage about Green Lantern Coaster does not provide information about its top speed either.

Green Lantern stands 155 feet (47\u00a0m) tall and features a top speed of 63 miles per hour (101\u00a0km/h). The 4,155-foot-long (1,266\u00a0m) ride features five inversions and a duration of approximately 21\u20442 minutes. This steel coaster was designed and built by Swiss manufacturer Bolliger & Mabillard.. The ride originally operated at Kentucky Kingdom in Louisville, Kentucky from 1997 to 2009, where it was known as Chang.\nThought 7: The top speed of the Green Lantern roller coaster at Six Flags Great Adventure is 63 mph. Now that I have the top speeds of both roller coasters, I can compare them. The Riddler's Revenge has a top speed of 65 mph, while the Green Lantern has a top speed of 63 mph.

She is the most successful alpine ski racer of her country, the fourth most successful female ski racer ever (after Lindsey Vonn, Annemarie Moser-Pr\u00f6ll and Mikaela Shiffrin) and was voted \"Swiss Sportswoman of the Century\".. Schneider was born in Elm, the daughter of a shoemaker. Her mother died of cancer when Schneider was a teenager: as a result she put her ski career on hold and dropped out of school to look after the family home.[1]. Schneider made her World Cup debut at the age of 20.[1] Schneider won the overall alpine skiing World Cup three times and eleven discipline World Cups in Slalom and Giant slalom, along with 55 World Cup races (number four all-time among women to Moser-Pr\u00f6ll, Vonn and Shiffrin).\nThought 3: Vreni Schneider is not the most successful female ski racer; she is the fourth most successful.

She won four World Cup overall championships \u2013 third amongst female skiers to Annemarie Moser-Pr\u00f6ll and Mikaela Shiffrin \u2013 with three consecutive titles in 2008, 2009, and 2010,[2] plus another in 2012.[3] Vonn won the gold medal in downhill at the 2010 Winter Olympics, the first one for an American woman.[4] She also won a record eight World Cup season titles in the downhill discipline (2008\u20132013, 2015, 2016), five titles in super-G (2009\u20132012, 2015), and three consecutive titles in the combined (2010\u20132012). In 2016, she won her 20th World Cup crystal globe title, the overall record for men or women, surpassing Ingemar Stenmark of Sweden, who won 19 globes from 1975 to 1984. She has the third highest super ranking of all skiers, men or women.. Vonn is one of six women[5] to have won World Cup races in all five disciplines of alpine skiing \u2013 downhill, super-G, giant slalom, slalom, and super combined \u2013 and won 82 World Cup races in her career.\nThought 4: Lindsey Vonn is not the most successful female ski racer; she is third amongst female skiers to Annemarie Moser-Pr\u00f6ll and Mikaela Shiffrin.

She was the most successful female alpine ski racer during the 1970s, with six overall titles, including five consecutive from 1971 to 1975, and she remained the career leader in World Cup wins with 62 until 2015 when her total was surpassed by Lindsey Vonn. Moser-Pr\u00f6ll celebrated her biggest successes in downhill, giant slalom, and combined races.\nThought 5: Annemarie Moser-Pr\u00f6ll was the most successful female alpine ski racer during the 1970s, but her total World Cup wins were surpassed by Lindsey Vonn in 2015. This suggests that Lindsey Vonn might be the most successful female ski racer. However, Mikaela Shiffrin was also mentioned as being more successful than Lindsey Vonn.

The group's pioneering music used minimalist electronic instrumentation, including synthesizers and primitive drum machines, and their early performances were confrontational and often ended in violence.[7] They were among the first acts to use the phrase \"punk music\" in an advertisement for a concert in 1970\u2014during their very brief stint as a three-piece including Paul Liebegott.[8][9]. Though never widely popular among the general public, Suicide have been recognized as among the most influential acts of their era. Their debut album Suicide (1977) was described by Entertainment Weekly as \"a landmark of electronic music\",[10] while AllMusic stated that it \"provided the blueprints for post-punk, synth pop, and industrial rock.\"[11].

The following year, Cage made his feature film acting debut with a minor role in Fast Times at Ridgemont High, the second and last time he went by his birth name Nicolas Coppola, which he changed professionally to avoid allegations of nepotism due to his connection to the Coppola family.[1] In 1983, Cage starred in the teen romantic comedy Valley Girl alongside Deborah Foreman and had a supporting role in Francis Ford Coppola's Rumble Fish.. In 1984, Cage portrayed a fictionalized version of hitman Mad Dog Coll in Coppola's The Cotton Club and appeared in Birdy, a feature the National Board of Review listed among the top ten films of that year.[2] He starred in Coppola's Peggy Sue Got Married in 1986 before leading the 1987 crime comedy Raising Arizona, written and directed by the Coen brothers.[3] In 1988, he earned a Golden Globe nomination for Best Actor \u2013 Motion Picture Musical or Comedy for his role as the romantic lead in Moonstruck.[4] In 1989, he appeared in the black comedy film Vampire's Kiss, a box-office bomb that later gained a cult following for his \"chaotic\" performance.[5][6] In 1990, he led the David Lynch film Wild at Heart.. In 1992, Cage earned his second Golden Globe nomination for the romantic comedy Honeymoon in Vegas.[4] Three years later, he starred as a suicidal alcoholic in the critically acclaimed Leaving Las Vegas, for which he received a BAFTA Award nomination for Best Actor in a Leading Role,[7] and earned the Golden Globe for Best Actor \u2013 Motion Picture Drama and the Academy Award for Best Actor.[4][8] In 2002, he made his directorial debut with Sonny and portrayed filmmaker Charlie Kaufman in Adaptation, another critically acclaimed film that earned him his most recent Best Actor nominations from the Academy Awards,[8] BAFTA,[9] and Golden Globes.[4]. In the 1990s, Cage's career rocketed as a leading man; films of his that made over $100 million in theaters included The Rock (1996), Con Air (1997), Face/Off (1997), City of Angels (1998), Snake Eyes (1998), Gone in 60 Seconds (2000), The Family Man (2000), National Treasure and its sequel (2004; 2007), World Trade Center (2006), Ghost Rider and its sequel (2007; 2011), Knowing (2009), and The Sorcerer's Apprentice (2010).[10] In the 2010s, Cage found himself \"taking roles left and right\" after a series of box-office disappointments and to pay off his debts to the IRS, placing him in numerous films, many going direct-to-video.[11][12] His participation in various genres during this time increased his popularity and gained him a cult following.[13][14] Luke Buckmaster, writing for The Guardian, said, \"In Cage's hands, cartoonish moments are imbued with real emotion and real emotions become cartoons.\nThought 7: The filmography of Nicolas Cage includes a movie called \"The Family Man\" from 2000.

Fran\u00e7ois Malepart Beaucourt was born in Laprairie, Quebec.[2] Paul Beaucourt, his father, was an amateur painter and military engineer. After he died, the family seems to have returned to France.[3] In 1773, Beaucourt married the daughter of his painting master, Joseph Camagne, in Bordeaux, afterwards painting in France and Russia.[2][3] He was accepted into the local academy in Bordeaux in 1784.[3] In Canada, after 1786, he painted a wide variety of subjects, mostly portraits, including a self-portrait in the National Gallery of Canada. In 1792, he worked in Philadelphia but returned to Montreal that year.[3] In 1794, he died in Montreal.[2] One critic speaks of his \"decorative and light provincial rococo\" manner.[3].

The style of progressive rock that Vander developed with Magma is termed \"Zeuhl\", and has been applied to other bands in France operating in the same period, and to some recent Japanese bands.[2]. Vander created a fictional language, Koba\u00efan, in which most lyrics are sung.[3] In a 1977 interview with Vander and long-time Magma vocalist Klaus Blasquiz, Blasquiz said that Koba\u00efan is a \"phonetic language made by elements of the Slavonic and Germanic languages to be able to express some things musically. The language has of course a content, but not word by word.\"[4] Vander himself has said, \"When I wrote, the sounds [of Koba\u00efan] came naturally with it\u2014I didn't intellectualise the process by saying 'Ok, now I'm going to write some words in a particular language', it was really sounds that were coming at the same time as the music.\"[5] In the course of their first album, the band tells the story of a group of people fleeing a doomed Earth to settle on the planet Koba\u00efa.

I will start by searching for information on the history of Belgium. Action 1: Search[History of Belgium]\nAction 1: Search[History of Belgium]\nObservation 1: For most of its history, what is now Belgium was either a part of a larger territory, such as the Carolingian Empire, or divided into a number of smaller states, prominent among them being the Duchy of Lower Lorraine,  the Duchy of Brabant, the County of Flanders, the Prince-Bishopric of Li\u00e8ge, the County of Namur, the County of Hainaut and the County of Luxembourg. Due to its strategic location as a country of contact between different cultures, Belgium has been called the \"crossroads of Europe\"; for the many armies fighting on its soil, it has also been called the \"battlefield of Europe\"[1] or the \"cockpit of Europe\".[2]. Belgium's modern shape can be traced back at least as far as the southern core of the medieval Burgundian Netherlands. The Eighty Years' War (1568\u20131648) later led to the split between a northern Dutch Republic and the Southern Netherlands from which Belgium and Luxembourg developed. The area, long a Habsburg stronghold, briefly came under Bourbon control during the War of the Spanish Succession.\nThought 2: The phrase \"cockpit of Europe\" is mentioned in the history of Belgium.

But it was during Magellan's voyage of discovery of the Philippines in 1521 when modern cockfighting was first witnessed and documented for Westerners by the Italian Antonio Pigafetta, Magellan's chronicler, in the Kingdom of Taytay.. The gamecocks (not to be confused with game birds), are specially bred and conditioned for increased stamina and strength. Male and female chickens of such a breed are referred to as gamefowl.[citation needed] Cocks possess congenital aggression toward all males of the same species.[clarification needed][citation needed] Wagers are often made on the outcome of the match, held in a ring called a cockpit..\nThought 3: The phrase \"cockpit of Europe\" does not appear in the context of cockfighting.

During World War I Franz Joseph served in Germany's Imperial Navy (Kaiserliche Marine) as the second torpedo officer on the light cruiser SMS Emden at the Battle of Cocos.[2] The SMS Emden had an extraordinary record capturing British ships, and as a result all those who served on her, including Franz Joseph, were given the right to add the ship's name to the end of their surnames.[3][4] Since Germany had converted titles of nobility into family names in 1919, he became Franz Joseph Prinz von Hohenzollern-Emden.[citation needed].\nThought 7: The information about Franz Joseph, Prince of Hohenzollern-Emden, mentions that he served on the SMS Emden.

He is quick to take orders from his superiors, chiefly his mother Agnes and Superintendent Chalmers.. Skinner's actions often involve ensuring the school has adequate funding.

Wilson is the son of Orville and Ngaire Wilson.[1] His father was born in Jamaica and his mother, Ngaire, was born in Wellington, New Zealand, and Wilson is the nephew of Maureen Jacobson, who played for the New Zealand women's national football team.[2][3] Wilson grew up in Simi Valley, California and attended Chaminade College Preparatory School.[4] As a junior, he caught 70 passes for 1,278 yards and 12 touchdowns.[5] Wilson was rated a four-star recruit and committed to play college football at Stanford after considering Notre Dame.[6][7]. Wilson played in all 13 of Stanford's games during his freshman season. He became a starter as a sophomore and led the Cardinal with 56 receptions and 672 receiving yards while scoring 5 touchdowns.\nThought 3: Michael Wilson's statistics do not match the ones given in the question.

The next player to search for is Michael Wilson. However, I've already searched for him and his statistics didn't match. Therefore, I need to find another player to search for.

Having grown from its initial roots as a resort-oriented master-planned community first begun in 1974, developer George P. Mitchell's The Woodlands began to rapidly grow with an influx of new families from Houston and other areas, and had also gained national prominence from the community being both host to the Shell Houston Open and home to the Cynthia Woods Mitchell Pavilion, which opened in 1990. By the 1990s, the community (and Montgomery County) had grown enough to the point where a new super-regional mall became a key priority of the community's developer, The Woodlands Corporation, who sought to develop the mall as part of its Town Center development..\nThought 5: The information about The Woodlands Mall does not mention it being a \"twin\" to another mall. However, it is located at the intersection of Interstate 45, which is a detail from the original question. It's possible that this could be the mall in question, but without more information or a direct reference to it being a \"twin\" mall, I can't be certain.

Action 2: Search[Voice]\nAction 2: Search[Voice]\nObservation 2: The human voice consists of sound made by a human being using the vocal tract, including talking, singing, laughing, crying, screaming, shouting, humming or yelling. The human voice frequency is specifically a part of human sound production in which the vocal folds (vocal cords) are the primary sound source. (Other sound production mechanisms produced from the same general area of the body involve the production of unvoiced consonants, clicks, whistling and whispering.). Generally speaking, the mechanism for generating the human voice can be subdivided into three parts; the lungs, the vocal folds within the larynx (voice box), and the articulators. The lungs, the \"pump\" must produce adequate airflow and air pressure to vibrate vocal folds.\nThought 3: The search result for \"Voice\" is not related to the movie.

Two young Protestant men, Andrew Robb and David McIlwaine, were beaten and repeatedly stabbed to death in what was part of a Loyalist feud between the Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF) and their rivals, the breakaway Loyalist Volunteer Force (LVF). The men were not members of any loyalist paramilitary organisation. It later emerged in court hearings that Robb had made disparaging remarks about the killing of UVF Mid-Ulster Brigade leader Richard Jameson by an LVF gunman the previous month.[1] This had angered the killers, themselves members of the Mid-Ulster UVF, and in retaliation they had lured the two men to the remote lane on the outskirts of town, where they killed and mutilated them.. Three men had carried out the double killing: Stephen Leslie Brown (also known as Stephen Leslie Revels), Noel Dillon, and Mark Burcombe.\nThought 2: The Tandragee killings took place in County Armagh, Northern Ireland.

The county borders Louth and Monaghan to the south and southwest, which are in the Republic of Ireland. It is named after its county town, Armagh, which derives from the Irish Ard Mhacha, meaning \"Macha's height\".\nThought 3: The information about County Armagh doesn't include a nickname.

Juan Atkins was born in Detroit, Michigan.[1] His father is a concert promoter.[9] At an early age, he played guitar and bass guitar in funk/garage bands with his friends.[9] After his parents split, he moved to Belleville, Michigan.[9] In junior high school, he met Derrick May and Kevin Saunderson.[10] The three would later be known as the Belleville Three.[10] At the age of 15, he bought his first synthesizer, a Korg MS-10.[5]. Juan Atkins formed Cybotron with Richard Davis in 1980.[11] The duo's debut studio album, Enter, was released in 1983.[12] Atkins and Davis split ways in 1985.[13].

I need to find out which puzzle-platform video game was developed by Valve Corporation first. Action 1:\nAction 1: Search[Valve Corporation]\nObservation 1: Valve Corporation, also known as Valve Software, is an American video game developer, publisher, and digital distribution company headquartered in Bellevue, Washington. It is the developer of the software distribution platform Steam and the game franchises Half-Life, Counter-Strike, Portal, Day of Defeat, Team Fortress, Left 4 Dead and Dota.. Valve was founded in 1996 by the former Microsoft employees Gabe Newell and Mike Harrington. Their debut game, the first-person shooter (FPS) Half-Life (1998), was a critical and commercial success and had a lasting influence on the FPS genre. Harrington left in 2000.\nThought 2: The game franchises developed by Valve Corporation include Half-Life, Counter-Strike, Portal, Day of Defeat, Team Fortress, Left 4 Dead and Dota. Among these, Portal is a puzzle-platform video game. I should look up more information about Portal to see if it's part of a 2012 action-adventure game. \nAction 2: Search[Portal video game]\nObservation 2: Portal is a 2007 puzzle-platform game developed and published by Valve. It was released in a bundle, The Orange Box, for Windows, Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3, and has been since ported to other systems, including Mac OS X, Linux, Android (via Nvidia Shield), and Nintendo Switch.. Portal consists primarily of a series of puzzles that must be solved by teleporting the player's character and simple objects using \"the Aperture Science Handheld Portal Device\", also referred to as the \"portal gun\", a device that can create intra-spatial portals between two flat planes. The player-character, Chell, is challenged and taunted by an artificial intelligence named GLaDOS (Genetic Lifeform and Disk Operating System) to complete each puzzle in the Aperture Science Enrichment Center using the portal gun with the promise of receiving cake when all the puzzles are completed. The Source Engine's physics system allows kinetic energy to be retained through portals, requiring creative use of portals to maneuver through the test chambers.\nThought 3: Portal was released in 2007 as part of The Orange Box bundle. However, this doesn't answer the question about a 2012 action-adventure game. I need to find out if Portal or The Orange Box has any connection to a 2012 action-adventure game. \nAction 3: Search[The Orange Box]\nObservation 3: The Orange Box is a video game compilation containing five games developed and published by Valve. Two of the games included, Half-Life 2 and its first stand-alone expansion, Episode One; had previously been released as separate products. Three new games were also included in the compilation: the second stand-alone expansion, Half-Life 2: Episode Two; the puzzle game Portal; and Team Fortress 2, the multiplayer game sequel to Team Fortress Classic. Valve also released a soundtrack containing music from the games within the compilation. A separate product entitled The Black Box was planned, which would have included only the new games, but was later canceled..\nThought 4: The Orange Box, which includes Portal, was a compilation of games developed by Valve, but it doesn't seem to be connected to a 2012 action-adventure game. I need to find out if there's a sequel or another game related to Portal that was released in 2012. \nAction 4: Search[Portal video game sequel]\nObservation 4: Could not find Portal video game sequel.

This could be the sequel I'm looking for. I should look up more information about Portal 2 to see if it's part of a 2012 action-adventure game.\nAction 5: Search[Portal 2]\nObservation 5: Portal 2 is a 2011 puzzle-platform game developed by Valve for Windows, Mac OS X, Linux, PlayStation 3, and Xbox 360. The digital PC version is distributed online by Valve's Steam service, while all retail editions were distributed by Electronic Arts. A port for the Nintendo Switch was included as part of Portal: Companion Collection.. Like the original Portal (2007), players solve puzzles by placing portals and teleporting between them. Portal 2 adds features including tractor beams, lasers, light bridges, and paint-like gels that alter player movement or allow portals to be placed on any surface.\nThought 6: Portal 2 was released in 2011, not 2012, and it doesn't seem to be part of any 2012 action-adventure game.

Action 1:\nAction 1: Search[\"Van Diemen's Land\"]\nObservation 1: Van Diemen's Land was the colonial name of the island of Tasmania used by the British during the European exploration and colonisation of Australia in the 19th century. The island was previously discovered and named by the Dutch in 1642. Explorer Abel Tasman discovered the island, working under the sponsorship of Anthony van Diemen, the Governor-General of the Dutch East Indies. The British retained the name when they established a settlement in 1803 before it became a separate colony in 1825. Its penal colonies became notorious destinations for the transportation of convicts due to the harsh environment, isolation and reputation for being inescapable..\nThought 2: The film \"Van Diemen's Land\" is named after the colonial name of Tasmania, which was used by the British during the 19th century. The island was known for its penal colonies and was a notorious destination for the transportation of convicts.

Phuture's seminal \"Acid Tracks\" is considered to be the first acid house record and credited for inventing and defining the genre.[1][2] The 12-minute instrumental composition was released on Trax Records in 1987. Originally, it was recorded to tape and played by DJ Ron Hardy at the Chicago nightclub Music Box,[3] supposedly already in 1985.[4] Its characteristic \"acid\" sound was derived from utilizing the Roland TB-303 bass synthesizer in a very particular way, using tone sequences modulated in real-time to produce a certain resonant and squelchy sound which is since then associated with the genre. The track also utilized Roland TR-707 and Roland TR-727 drum machines.. After \"Acid Tracks\", Phuture released a number of acid house and Chicago house tracks now considered classics of the genre, usually as 12-inch vinyl maxi singles.\nThought 2: Phuture is an American house music group that is known for inventing and defining the sound of acid house, a subgenre of house music.

Action 2: Search[Acid house]\nAction 2: Search[Acid house]\nObservation 2: Acid house (also simply known as just \"acid\") is a subgenre of house music developed around the mid-1980s by DJs from Chicago. The style is defined primarily by the squelching sounds and basslines of the Roland TB-303 electronic bass synthesizer-sequencer,[1] an innovation attributed to Chicago artists Phuture and Sleezy D circa 1986.. Acid house soon became popular in the United Kingdom and continental Europe, where it was played by DJs in the acid house and later rave scenes. By the late 1980s, acid house had moved into the British mainstream, where it had some influence on pop and dance styles.. Acid house brought house music to a worldwide audience.[3] The influence of acid house can be heard in later styles of dance music including trance, hardcore, jungle, big beat, techno and trip hop.[4][5].\nThought 3: The information confirms that acid house, a subgenre of house music that Phuture started, spread to the United Kingdom and Europe. It became popular in these regions and was played by DJs in the acid house and later rave scenes. By the late 1980s, acid house had moved into the British mainstream.

Right from the start Hossein established his characteristic trademarks: using a seemingly straightforward suspense plot and subverting its conventions (sometimes to the extent of a complete disregard of the traditional demand for a final twist or revelation) in order to concentrate on ritualistic relationships.[citation needed] This is the director's running preoccupation which is always stressed in his films by an extraordinary command of film space and often striking frame compositions where the geometry of human figures and set design is used to accentuate the psychological set-up of the scene.\n"}, {"steps": 6, "answer": "Information not available", "gt_answer": "Ellesmere Port", "question_idx": 209, "reward": false, "em": false, "f1": 0, "n_calls": 12, "n_badcalls": 6, "traj": "Solve a question answering task with interleaving Thought, Action, Observation steps.

The play then transitions to Paris where she continues her freak show act before dying in 1815 after being under the study of a group of French scientists led by Georges Cuvier.[1] Her deceased body becomes the subject of a pseudoscientific autopsy that focuses on Baartman's steatopygia\u2013 a condition which Cuvier (who appears as the Baron Docteur in Venus), uses to his academic advantage.[1] Parks' work is not intended to be historically accurate, but rather uses the concept of Baartman's career to explore colonialism, racialization, and the historical sexualization of Black women;[2] as Parks explains, \"most of it's fabricated...

Creative direction of American Dad! had largely been guided by Barker (prior to his departure from the show in season 10) and Weitzman as opposed to MacFarlane, resulting in a series that is different from its counterparts.[7] Unlike MacFarlane's other shows, Family Guy and, to a lesser extent, The Cleveland Show, American Dad! does not lean as heavily on the use of cutaway gags, and is less concerned with conventional \"setup-punchline\" jokes,[3] instead deriving its humor mostly from the quirky characters, the relationships between family members, and the relatively relatable plots.[2] While the core issues and resolutions are relatable in most episodes, the show nonetheless weaves in fantastical elements, pitching the tone of the show somewhere between observational comedy and farce.[3] The plots are often absurd, but grounded by family stories and real-world issues.[3]. American Dad! has been nominated for numerous awards, including four Primetime Emmy Awards and two Annie Awards. In June 2013, it was awarded as top television series by the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers.\nThought 3: American Dad! was created by Seth MacFarlane, Mike Barker, and Matt Weitzman.

It was the \"first complete printed history of England composed as a continuous narrative\".[2] The Holinshed Chronicles was a major influence on many Renaissance writers, such as Shakespeare, Spenser, Daniel and Marlowe.[3]. Little is known about Holinshed's life and for the most part his early years are primarily a matter of speculation. Holinshed was most likely born to Ralph Holinshed of Cophurst in Sutton Downes, Cheshire.

On 3 November 2000, Damgaard won the European welterweight title in a split decision over Alessandro Duran.[3] No defences were made, but Damgaard continued to spend the next five years undefeated, fighting exclusively in Denmark.. On 28 January 2006, Damgaard travelled abroad for the first time to face established veteran Arturo Gatti in the United States. A fan-friendly slugfest was the result, at the end of which Damgaard was stopped on his feet in eleven rounds after trailing on all three judges' scorecards.[4] It would prove to be the penultimate fight in Damgaard's career, and the third-last for Gatti.\nThought 6: Thomas Damgaard is a Danish former professional boxer who held the European super-lightweight title and the European welterweight title.

The club lost 1\u20130 in the 1900 Leinster Senior Cup final to local rivals Shelbourne in a tight game.[4]  Its highest achievement was reaching the 1901 Irish Cup final at Grosvenor Park in Belfast, but lost 1\u20130 to Cliftonville, the Whites handicapped by playing much of the match with 10 men after an early injury to full-back Ryan.[5] Freebooters had beaten Linfield F.C. 2\u20131 in the semi-final at the Jones Road venue.[6].\nThought 2: The information about Freebooters F.C. doesn't mention the city where they lost a match that is now known as Croke Park. However, it does mention that they played a match at the Jones Road venue. Since Croke Park is also a venue, it's possible that Jones Road is the old name for Croke Park.

Since Freebooters F.C. played at the Jones Road venue, and this venue is now known as Croke Park, the city where they lost must be the same city where Croke Park is located. I'll search for \"Croke Park\" to confirm the city.

Named after Archbishop Thomas Croke, it is referred to as Croker by GAA fans and locals.[2] It serves as both the principal national stadium of Ireland and headquarters of the Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA). Since 1891[3] the site has been used by the GAA to host Gaelic sports, including the annual All-Ireland finals in Gaelic football and hurling.. A major expansion and redevelopment of the stadium ran from 1991 to 2005, raising capacity to its current 82,300 spectators.[4] This makes Croke Park the fourth-largest stadium in Europe, and the largest not usually used for association football in Europe.. Along with other events held at the stadium include the opening and closing ceremonies of the 2003 Special Olympics, and numerous musical concerts.\nThought 4: Croke Park is located in Dublin, Ireland. Since this is the current name for the Jones Road venue where Freebooters F.C. played, the city where they lost a match that is now known as Croke Park must be Dublin.

In the years leading up to release, West had received praise for his production work for rappers such as Jay-Z and Talib Kweli, but faced difficulty being accepted as an artist in his own right by figures in the music industry. Intent on pursuing a solo career, he signed a record deal with Roc-A-Fella and recorded the album over a period of four years, beginning in 1999.. The production of The College Dropout was primarily handled by West and showcased his \"chipmunk soul\" musical style, which made use of sped-up, pitch shifted vocal samples from soul and R&B records, in addition to West's own drum programming, string accompaniments, and gospel choirs; the album also features contributions from Jay-Z, Mos Def, Jamie Foxx, Syleena Johnson, and Ludacris, among others.\nThought 4: \"The College Dropout\" was released by Roc-A-Fella Records, which fits one part of the question's criteria. However, the observation doesn't mention Dwele as a contributor to this album.

Action 4: Search[Late Registration]\nAction 4: Search[Late Registration]\nObservation 4: Late Registration is the second studio album by the American rapper Kanye West. It was released on August 30, 2005, through Roc-A-Fella Records and Def Jam Recordings. West recorded the album over the course of a year during sessions held at studios in Hollywood and New York City, in collaboration with Jon Brion. The album features guest appearances from Adam Levine, Jamie Foxx, Common, Brandy, Jay-Z, and Nas, among others.. West's production for Late Registration departed from the sped-up soul samples of his debut studio album, The College Dropout (2004), moving towards a more elaborate and orchestral style with a 20-piece ensemble.\nThought 5: \"Late Registration\" was also released by Roc-A-Fella Records, but the observation doesn't mention Dwele as a contributor. I should continue searching through Kanye West's discography. The next album is \"Graduation\". Action 5: Search[Graduation]\nAction 5: Search[Graduation]\nObservation 5: A graduation is the awarding of a diploma by an educational institution.[1][2] It may also refer to the ceremony that is associated with it, which can also be called commencement, congregation, convocation or invocation.

Capdevila (category Fellows of the American Heart Association)'].\nThought 2: The search did not directly answer the question, but it did suggest 'Aldosterone' which is a hormone that might be related to sodium retention. I should look into this further. Action 2: Search[Aldosterone]\nAction 2: Search[Aldosterone]\nObservation 2: Aldosterone is the main mineralocorticoid steroid hormone produced by the zona glomerulosa of the adrenal cortex in the adrenal gland.[4][5] It is essential for sodium conservation in the kidney, salivary glands, sweat glands, and colon.[6]  It plays a central role in the homeostatic regulation of blood pressure, plasma sodium (Na+), and potassium (K+) levels. It does so primarily by acting on the mineralocorticoid receptors in the distal tubules and collecting ducts of the nephron.[6] It influences the reabsorption of sodium and excretion of potassium (from and into the tubular fluids, respectively) of the kidney, thereby indirectly influencing water retention or loss, blood pressure, and blood volume.[7] When dysregulated, aldosterone is pathogenic and contributes to the development and progression of cardiovascular and kidney disease.[8] Aldosterone has exactly the opposite function of the atrial natriuretic hormone secreted by the heart.[7]. Aldosterone is part of the renin\u2013angiotensin\u2013aldosterone system. It has a plasma half-life of less than 20 minutes.[9] Drugs that interfere with the secretion or action of aldosterone are in use as antihypertensives, like lisinopril, which lowers blood pressure by blocking the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), leading to lower aldosterone secretion. The net effect of these drugs is to reduce sodium and water retention but increase the retention of potassium.\nThought 3: The information about Aldosterone confirms that it is a hormone that promotes sodium retention in the kidney, specifically in the distal tubules and collecting ducts of the nephron. It also states that Aldosterone is produced by the zona glomerulosa of the adrenal cortex in the adrenal gland. This should be the answer to the question.

Introduced as the Blue Bird Transit Home in 1963, the Wanderlodge was a derivative of the Blue Bird All American school bus for over year; two further generations were produced, adapting motorcoach body and chassis design.. Assembled by Blue Bird in Fort Valley, Georgia, each example of the Wanderlodge was built to customer specification.[1] In complete contrast to Blue Bird school buses, no two Wanderlodges were alike; each example was assembled with a hand-crafted interior, with over 200 available options (with some examples adding additional customization).[1]  Through much of its first generation, the Wanderlodge was priced in comparison to a medium-sized American home (dependent on customization);[1] latter examples would rise significantly in price, competing against coaches from Newell and Prevost. Highly prized by their owners,[2][3] many examples were sold to middle/upper-class families, with some examples sold to celebrities and heads of state around the world.[1]. As part of a reorganization of Blue Bird Corporation, the rights to the Wanderlodge model line were sold in 2007, with the model line ending production in 2009, after 44 years of continuous production..\nThought 2: The Blue Bird Wanderlodge is described as a series of recreational vehicles.

I will need to search for Tim O'Kelly to find out more about his film career and the roles he was cast in. Action 1:\nAction 1: Search[Tim O'Kelly]\nObservation 1: Tim O'Kelly (variously O'Kelley; born Timothy Patrick Wright,[1]  March 12, 1941 \u2013 January 4, 1990) was an American actor best known for playing the sniper in Peter Bogdanovich's film Targets (1968).. O'Kelly first gained attention as a stage actor with the Santa Monica Group Theater.[2][3][4] He later served as a director and acting coach with the group.[5][6] Among the stage productions he appeared in was Peter Shaffer's The Private Ear/The Public Eye.[7] Much of his television work was in Western series such as The Monroes,[8] Cimarron Strip,[9] The Big Valley,[10] and The Guns of Will Sonnett,[11] although he also made appearances in Batman.[12][13] O'Kelly also played Detective Danny \"Danno\" Williams in the pilot episode of Hawaii Five-O, but was replaced by James MacArthur after a preview audience found O'Kelly \"too young\" for the part.[14][15]. His one major film appearance was opposite Boris Karloff in Peter Bogdanovich's directorial debut Targets (1968), in which he played the spree killer Bobby Thompson, a character loosely based on Texas tower sniper Charles Whitman.[16] His final confirmed acting role was the 1970 film The Grasshopper (as the boyfriend of Jacqueline Bisset's character),[17] after which he faded from the public eye.. O'Kelly was the son of Maurice Wayne Wright and Billie Jo Chew.[1][18][19]  He had a brief marriage to actress Evelyn Rudie, whom he married in 1968.[1][20] Vital records indicate he died of cardiomyopathy in Los Angeles on January 4, 1990, aged 48.[19][21][22]. Main pageContentsCurrent eventsRandom articleAbout WikipediaContact usDonate.\nThought 2: The information provided mentions that Tim O'Kelly played a character named Bobby Thompson in the film \"Targets\". This character was loosely based on the Texas tower sniper Charles Whitman. This suggests that Tim O'Kelly was cast in the film because he resembled Charles Whitman, who could be considered a killer. However, the text does not mention a nickname for Charles Whitman. I should look up Charles Whitman to confirm if he had a nickname. Action 2: Search[Charles Whitman]\nAction 2: Search[Charles Whitman]\nObservation 2: Charles Joseph Whitman (June 24, 1941 \u2013 August 1, 1966) was an American mass murderer and Marine veteran who became known as the \"Texas Tower Sniper\". On August 1, 1966, Whitman used knives to kill his mother and his wife in their respective homes, then went to the University of Texas at Austin (UT Austin) with multiple firearms and began indiscriminately shooting at people. He fatally shot three people inside UT Austin's Main Building, then accessed the 28th-floor observation deck on the building's clock tower. There, he fired at random people for 96 minutes, killing an additional eleven people and wounding 31 others before he was shot dead by Austin Texas law enforcement. Whitman killed a total of seventeen people; the 17th victim died 35 years later from injuries sustained in the attack.[2][3][4][5].\nThought 3: The information provided confirms that Charles Whitman was known as the \"Texas Tower Sniper\". This is likely the nickname that Tim O'Kelly's character in the film \"Targets\" was meant to resemble.

The most relevant ones seem to be \"Narcissus (mythology)\" and \"Echo and Narcissus\". I'll try searching for \"Narcissus (mythology)\" first, as it's likely to give a broad overview of the character and his relationships. Action 2: Search[Narcissus (mythology)]\nAction 2: Search[Narcissus (mythology)]\nObservation 2: In Greek mythology, Narcissus (/n\u0251\u02d0r\u02c8s\u026as\u0259s/; Ancient Greek: \u039d\u03ac\u03c1\u03ba\u03b9\u03c3\u03c3\u03bf\u03c2, romanized:\u00a0N\u00e1rkissos) was a hunter from Thespiae in Boeotia (alternatively Mimas or modern day Karaburun, Izmir) who was known for his beauty which was noticed by all, regardless of gender. According to the best known version of the story, by Ovid, Narcissus rejected all advances, eventually falling in love with a reflection in a pool of water, tragically not realizing its similarity, entranced by it. In some versions, he beat his breast purple in agony at being kept apart from this reflected love, and in his place sprouted a flower bearing his name.. The character of Narcissus is the origin of the term narcissism, a self-centered personality style. This quality in extreme contributes to the definition of narcissistic personality disorder, a psychiatric condition marked by grandiosity, excessive need for attention and admiration, and an inability to empathize..\nThought 3: The information about Narcissus from Greek mythology doesn't mention any nymph or her mother. However, the search results also suggested \"Echo and Narcissus\", which might contain more specific information about the nymphs associated with Narcissus. I should search for that next. Action 3: Search[Echo and Narcissus]\nAction 3: Search[Echo and Narcissus]\nObservation 3: Echo and Narcissus is a myth from Ovid's Metamorphoses, a Roman mythological epic from the Augustan Age. The introduction of the myth of the mountain nymph Echo into the story of Narcissus, the beautiful youth who rejected Echo and fell in love with his own reflection, appears to have been Ovid's invention. Ovid's version influenced the presentation of the myth in later Western art and literature.. The myth of the goddess is told in Book III of the Metamorphoses, and tells the story of a \"talkative nymph\", or Echo, whom the goddess Venus admires for her magnificent voice and song. When Echo tricks Juno into believing that her husband, Jupiter, was in the city, Juno curses Echo by making her unable to initiate a spoken sentence on her own, and instead able only to, in speech, finish a sentence started by someone else.\nThought 4: The myth of \"Echo and Narcissus\" introduces the nymph Echo into the story of Narcissus. However, it doesn't mention Echo's mother or whether she fell in love with Narcissus. The information about Echo tricking Juno and being cursed is interesting, but it doesn't answer the question. I should look for more information about Echo's family to see if her mother is mentioned. Action 4: Search[Echo (mythology)]\nAction 4: Search[Echo (mythology)]\nObservation 4: In Greek mythology, Echo (/\u02c8\u025bko\u028a/; Greek: \u1f28\u03c7\u03ce, \u0112kh\u014d, \"echo\",[3] from \u1f26\u03c7\u03bf\u03c2 (\u0113chos), \"sound\"[4]) was an Oread who resided on Mount Cithaeron.[5] Zeus loved consorting with beautiful nymphs and often visited them on Earth. Eventually, Zeus's wife, Hera, became suspicious, and came from Mount Olympus in an attempt to catch Zeus with the nymphs. Echo, by trying to protect Zeus (as he had ordered her to do), endured Hera's wrath, and Hera made her only able to speak the last words spoken to her. So when Echo met Narcissus and fell in love with him, she was unable to tell him how she felt and was forced to watch him as he fell in love with himself.. In Metamorphoses (8 AD), the poet Ovid tells of Juno (Hera in Greek mythology) and the jealousy she felt over her husband Jupiter's (Zeus in Greek mythology) many affairs.\nThought 5: The information about Echo from Greek mythology doesn't mention her mother or whether she fell in love with Narcissus. It seems that Echo herself fell in love with Narcissus, but there's no mention of her mother. I might need to look up more information about nymphs in Greek mythology to see if there's a connection.

This could potentially provide information about the mothers of nymphs in Greek mythology. I'll try searching for \"Nymph\".

Distinct from other Greek goddesses, nymphs are generally regarded as personifications of nature; they are typically tied to a specific place, landform, or tree, and are usually depicted as maidens. Because of their association with springs, they were often seen as having healing properties;[1] other divine powers of the nymphs included divination and shapeshifting.[2] Nymphs, like other goddesses, were immortal except for the Hamadryads, whose lives were bound to a specific tree.[3]. Nymphs are divided into various broad subgroups based on their habitat,[4] such as the Meliae (ash tree nymphs), the Dryads (oak tree nymphs), the Alseids (grove nymphs), the Naiads (spring nymphs), the Nereids (sea nymphs), the Oceanids (ocean nymphs), the Oreads (mountain nymphs), and the Epimeliads (apple tree and flock nymphs). Other nymphs included the Hesperides (evening nymphs), the Hyades (rain nymphs), and the Pleiades (companions of Artemis)..\nThought 7: The information about nymphs in Greek mythology doesn't mention any specific nymph whose mother fell in love with Narcissus. It seems that the nymph Echo fell in love with Narcissus, but there's no mention of her mother.

The word \"Vodou\" comes from the Fon language (spoken in Dahomey) meaning \"spirit\" or \"god\".

As of the 2020 census, its population was 16,800, making it Maine's least-populous county.[1] Its county seat is Dover-Foxcroft.[2] The county was incorporated on March 23, 1838, taken from the western part of Penobscot County and the eastern part of Somerset County. It is named for an Abenaki word meaning \"branch of the river\" or \"at the river branch.\". Originally, the county extended north to the Canada\u2013US border, but in 1844 its northern portion was annexed by Aroostook County.\nThought 3: The information about Piscataquis County, Maine, does not mention anything about the smallest railroad in the United States in 1890.

However, it did suggest a similar topic: 'Maine Coast Railroad'. This might contain some useful information about the smallest railroad in the United States in 1890. I should look into this.\nAction 6: Search[\"Maine Coast Railroad\"]\nObservation 6: The Maine Coast Railroad was a railroad company that operated on tracks owned by the Maine Department of Transportation between 1990 and 2000.. The company started operations in 1990 after a contract was awarded to the Massachusetts Central Railroad (MCER) to operate the Rockland Branch between Brunswick and Rockland, Maine.[1] The MCER chose to create a new railroad to operate the line, named the Maine Coast.[1] During its first year, the railroad handled little traffic, but in 1991 a large cement producer on the line began shipping its product via rail.[1]  As a result of this increase in traffic, the Maine Coast acquired additional locomotives.[1]  In 1994, using funding from the Maine Department of Transportation, trackage in Rockland was rebuilt to allow freight to be transferred from the railroad to barges.[1] The railroad closed on December 4, 2000, after losing their lease to the tracks.[2] The lines formerly operated by Maine Coast Railroad was later operated by Maine Eastern Railroad between 2004 & 2015.[1]. It offered both freight service and passenger service.[3]  The passenger trains operated between Wiscasset and Warren, Maine.. Freight traffic largely consisted of cement products outbound from and coal inbound to Dragon Cement and Concrete in Thomaston.[1] There was also limited perlite and plastic products that moved along the line.[1]. The Maine Coast operated with a small roster of Alco and Montreal Locomotive Works locomotives, including a former Maine Central S-1 (No.\nThought 7: The information about the Maine Coast Railroad does not mention anything about the smallest railroad in the United States in 1890.
