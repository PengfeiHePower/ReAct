Notable for their campy aesthetics, technical errors, unsophisticated special effects, use of poorly-matched stock footage, eccentric casts, idiosyncratic stories and non sequitur dialogue, Wood's films remained largely obscure until he was posthumously awarded a Golden Turkey Award for Worst Director of All Time in 1980, renewing public interest in his life and work.[2].

Action 1: Search[Laleli Mosque]\nAction 1: Search[Laleli Mosque]\nObservation 1: The Laleli Mosque (Turkish: Laleli Camii, lit.\u2009'Tulip Mosque') is an 18th-century Ottoman imperial mosque located in Laleli, Fatih, Istanbul, Turkey.[1]. The mosque was commissioned by Sultan Mustafa III to serve as his imperial or sultanic mosque.[2][3] Although it was tradition among earlier sultans to build their imperial mosque in commemoration of a major military success, Mustafa III ignored this tradition by ordering the construction before any such victories.[3] Construction began on 5 April 1760 and was completed on 9 March 1764.[4][3] According to a contemporary writer, the mosque was officially named Nur Mustafa ('Light of Mustafa'), but it became popularly known as the Laleli Mosque ('Mosque of the Tulips') after the name of the neighbourhood where it was built.[3]. The architect of the mosque is not confirmed by historical documentation, but art historians have attributed the mosque to Mehmed Tahir Agha, the chief imperial architect at the time of the mosque's completion.[a][2][4][5] On average, about 770 workers were employed in the project and about two thirds of them were non-Muslims, the rest being Muslim.[5]. The mosque was the centerpiece of a larger complex (k\u00fclliye) that included the Mustafa III's tomb, a nearby caravanserai which provided some revenues to the complex, a sebil, and a madrasa.[6] Mustafa III was buried in the mausoleum attached to the complex after his death in 1774.[7] The mosque and its complex were damaged by the 1766 earthquake[4] and, according to \u00dcnver R\u00fcstem, by a fire in 1783.[7] In 1783 it was fully restored.[7][2] The restoration, which Do\u011fan Kuban attributes to the architect Seyit Mustafa Agha,[4][2] preserved the original mosque's appearance.[7] The mausoleum's fa\u00e7ade was updated with new marble window frames in the early 19th century.[6] The madrasa of the complex was destroyed by fire in 1911.[6]. The mosque was built in the Ottoman Baroque style of its time.[8][9][10] The layout is based on that of the earlier Selimiye Mosque of Edirne from the classical period, in accordance with Mustafa III's wishes.[11][5] The decoration of the mosque and its complex is firmly baroque.[12][2] The mosque incorporates thus the visual style of the earlier Nuruosmaniye Mosque \u2013 the first imperial mosque in the Ottoman Baroque style, completed by Mustafa III's predecessor \u2013 but in a more restrained way that integrates it with more traditional Ottoman architecture.[13].\nThought 2: The Laleli Mosque is located in the Laleli neighborhood of Fatih, Istanbul, Turkey.

Action 2: Search[Esma Sultan Mansion]\nAction 2: Search[Esma Sultan Mansion]\nObservation 2: The Esma Sultan Mansion (Turkish: Esma Sultan Yal\u0131s\u0131), a historical yal\u0131 located on the Bosphorus in the Ortak\u00f6y neighborhood of Istanbul, Turkey and named after its original owner Princess Esma Sultan, is used today as a cultural center after being redeveloped.. The three-storey brick manor was designed by the renowned architect Sarkis Balyan and finished in 1875 next to Ortak\u00f6y Mosque. It was presented to the Princess Esma Sultan, the daughter of Ottoman Sultan Abdulaziz, as a wedding gift in 1889.. The mansion remained in the possession of the Ottoman dynasty until 1915. Subsequently, the building was used first as a tobacco warehouse and then as a coal depot from 1920 until 1975 when it was destroyed by a fire.[1].\nThought 3: The Esma Sultan Mansion is located in the Ortak\u00f6y neighborhood of Istanbul, Turkey.

The members all met in high school in 1987 and founded Local H three years later. After Sparkman's departure in 1991 and Garcia's departure in 1993, Local H continued as an unorthodox two-piece setup.. Local H signed a record contract with Island Records in 1994, where they would go on to release three albums.

Despite numerous lineup shuffles and some periods of dormancy, the band has produced material steadily since 1984.. Something of an anomaly in Midwestern America, For Against\u2014especially early in its career\u2014has looked to a distinctly British aesthetic for inspiration, most obviously the post-punk scene exemplified by the early rosters of the Factory and 4AD record labels.. Featuring members of underground Lincoln bands Cartoon Pupils and Hymn to Joy, the band first called itself Glue, and then D.B.L., finally settling on Four Against One,[1] a name that reflected its status as a quintet at the time. Bassist Liz Panarelli's early departure gave way to keyboardist Jeffrey Runnings' shift to bass, as well as the band's truncation of its name to For Against.\nThought 3: The observation confirms that For Against is also an American band, specifically from Lincoln, Nebraska.

There are also educational and research sites in Garden City, Hays, Leavenworth, Parsons, and Topeka, an agricultural education center in rural north Douglas County, and branches of the medical school in Salina and Wichita. The university is a member of the Association of American Universities and is classified among \"R1: Doctoral Universities \u2013 Very high research activity\".[14]. Founded March 21, 1865, the university was opened in 1866 under a charter granted by the Kansas State Legislature in 1864[15] and legislation passed in 1863 under the state constitution, which was adopted two years after the 1861 admission of the former Kansas Territory as the 34th state into the Union.[16].

In Australia, Mexico, and New Zealand, these songs are called the team anthem, team song, or games song. First associated with collegiate sports, fight songs are also used by secondary schools and in professional sports.. Fight songs are sing-alongs, allowing sports fans to cheer collectively for their team.[2] These songs are commonly played several times at a sporting event.[1] For example, the band might play the fight song when entering the stadium, whenever their team scores, or while cheerleaders dance at halftime or during other breaks in the game.[1][3] In Australian rules football, the team song is traditionally sung by the winning team at the end of the game.. Some fight songs have a long history, connecting the fans who sing them to a time-honored tradition, frequently to music played by the institution's band.[1] An analysis of 65 college fight songs by FiveThirtyEight identified words commonly used in the lyrics of these songs, including fight, win, and victory.[4] Other common elements of fight song lyrics are mentioning the team's colors, spelling out the school's name, and using the words \"hail\" and \"rah.\"[4] Many songs were composed by students, alumni, or faculty of the institution; for example, Cole Porter wrote \"Bulldog\" for his alma mater Yale College.\nThought 6: The general information about fight songs doesn't help me find the specific fight song for the University of Kansas.

Beckham's professional club career began with Manchester United, where he made his first-team debut in 1992 at age 17.[11] With United, he won the Premier League title six times, the FA Cup twice, the FA Charity Shield twice, the Intercontinental Cup and the UEFA Champions League in 1999.[11] He then played four seasons with Real Madrid,[12] winning the La Liga championship in his final season with the club.[13] In July 2007, Beckham signed a five-year contract with Major League Soccer club LA Galaxy.[14] While a Galaxy player, he spent two loan spells in Italy with AC Milan in 2009 and 2010. He became the first British footballer to play 100 UEFA Champions League games.[11] He retired in May 2013 after a 20-year career.[15]. In international football, Beckham made his England debut on 1 September 1996, at the age of 21. He was captain for six years, earning 58 caps during his tenure.[16][17] He made 115 career appearances in total, appearing at three FIFA World Cups in 1998, 2002 and 2006 as well as two UEFA European Championships in 2000 and 2004.\nThought 2: The observation mentions that Beckham's professional club career began with Manchester United, where he made his first-team debut in 1992 at age 17.

Ferguson played as a forward for several Scottish clubs, including Dunfermline Athletic and Rangers. While playing for Dunfermline, he was the top goalscorer in the Scottish league in the 1965\u201366 season. Towards the end of his playing career he also worked as a coach, then started his managerial career with East Stirlingshire and St Mirren.\nThought 6: The observation confirms that Sir Alexander Chapman Ferguson, commonly known as Alex Ferguson, managed Manchester United from 1986 to 2013.

Roth was born in Tysmenitz near Stanislawow, Galicia, Austro-Hungary (now known as Tysmenytsia, near Ivano-Frankivsk, Galicia, Ukraine).[1] Although his parents never agreed on the exact date of his arrival in the United States, it is most likely that he and his mother landed at Ellis Island and began his life in New York in 1908. The family briefly lived in Brooklyn, and then on the Lower East Side, in the slums where his classic novel Call It Sleep is set. In 1914, they moved to Harlem.

As a firm believer in the British Empire, Childers served as a volunteer in the army expeditionary force in the Second Boer War in South Africa, but his experiences there began a gradual process of disillusionment with British imperialism. He was adopted as a candidate in British parliamentary elections, standing for the Liberal Party at a time when the party supported a treaty to establish Irish home rule, but he later became an advocate of Irish republicanism and the severance of all ties with Britain. On behalf of the Irish Volunteers, he smuggled guns into Ireland later used against British soldiers in the Easter Rebellion. He had a significant role in the negotiations between Ireland and Britain that culminated in the Anglo-Irish Treaty, but was elected as an anti-Treaty member of the first Irish parliament.\nThought 3: Robert Erskine Childers was English-born, so he is the writer from England between the two.

Gough chose his stage name from a character in the show Sam and the Magic Ball, which he saw on TV at a party in Trafford, Greater Manchester, in 1995. Before he thought of using this name he made some business cards, each one unique, with a printed picture of a drawing by his nephew and a small collage by Gough.. A chance meeting with Andy Votel at the Generation X bar in Manchester, where Gough's friends Scott Abraham and Damon Hayhurst were contributing to an exhibition by the Space Monkey Clothing Company and Votel was DJing, led to the foundation of Twisted Nerve Records.. In 2002, Q magazine named Badly Drawn Boy in their list of the \"50 Bands to See Before You Die\", although this was as part of a sub-list of \"5 Bands That Could Go Either Way\" on account of Gough's tendency to talk and tell stories for extended periods in concert rather than play songs..\nThought 2: Badly Drawn Boy is a stage name for Damon Michael Gough, who is a multi-instrumentalist.

Wolf Alice played their first gig at Highbury Garage in December 2010 supporting April in the Shade, after Rowsell and Oddie met the band at an open mic at the Hope and Anchor in Islington. They released their debut single \"Fluffy\" in February 2013 and followed it with \"Bros\" in May. They released their debut EP Blush in October, and its follow-up Creature Songs in May 2014.\nThought 4: Wolf Alice is a rock band consisting of four members: a singer, a guitarist, a bassist, and a drummer. This suggests that they use at least four instruments. However, the exact number of instruments they use is not mentioned.

After the February Revolution of 1917, he joined the newly formed provisional government, first as Minister of Justice, then as Minister of War, and after July as the government's second Minister-Chairman. He was the leader of the social-democratic Trudovik faction of the Socialist Revolutionary Party. Kerensky was also a vice-chairman of the Petrograd Soviet, a position that held a sizable amount of power.\nThought 2: Alexander Kerensky was a Russian lawyer and revolutionary who led the Russian Provisional Government and the short-lived Russian Republic for three months from late July to early November 1917.

The Bolshevik party, formally established in 1912, seized power in Russia in the October Revolution of 1917, and was later renamed the Russian Communist Party, All-Union Communist Party, and Communist Party of the Soviet Union. The party's ideology, based on Leninist and later Marxist\u2013Leninist principles, is known as Bolshevism.. The origin of the split was Lenin's support for a smaller party of professional revolutionaries, as opposed to the Menshevik desire for a broad party membership. The influence of the factions fluctuated in the years up to 1912, when the RSDLP formally split into two parties.\nThought 3: The Bolsheviks, led by Vladimir Lenin, were a far-left faction of the Marxist Russian Social Democratic Labour Party.

In addition, rival militant socialists, notably Makhnovia anarchists and Left SRs, as well as non-ideological Green armies, fought against both the Reds and the Whites.

I will start by searching for the Manchester Terrier.\nAction 1: Search[Manchester Terrier]\nObservation 1: The Manchester Terrier is a breed of dog of the smooth-haired terrier type. It was first bred in the 19th century to control vermin, notably rats, at which it excelled. So efficient at the task was it that it often appeared in rat-baiting pits until that sport, which had effectively been illegal in the UK since 1835, finally died out at the beginning of the 20th century.. The breed is generally healthy, although dogs can be affected by several inheritable genetic disorders. A crash in the number of registered Manchester Terriers following the Second World War has resulted in the Kennel Club categorising it as a vulnerable native breed, in danger of extinction..\nThought 2: The information about the Manchester Terrier does not mention any connection to the Gordon or Irish Setters. Now, I should look up the breed history and lineage of the Scotch Collie to see if there's any connection there.\nAction 2: Search[Scotch Collie]\nObservation 2: The Rough Collie (also known as the Long-Haired Collie) is a long-coated dog breed of medium to large size that, in its original form, was a type of collie used and bred for herding sheep in Scotland. More recent breeding has focused on the Collie as a show dog, and also companion. The breed specifications call for a distinctive long narrow tapered snout and tipped (semiprick) ears, so some dogs have their ears taped when young. Rough Collies generally come in shades of sable and white (sometimes mahogany), blue merle, tri-coloured, and colour-headed white.. Originating in the 19th century,[1] the breed is now well known through the stories of author Albert Payson Terhune about his dog Lad, and later with Eric Knight's character of Lassie and her novels, movies, and television shows..\nThought 3: The information about the Scotch Collie also does not mention any connection to the Gordon or Irish Setters.

He was one of the few European commanders who gained a victory over the Mahdists before Kitchener's Expedition, soundly defeating them at Agordat in 1893. After a long and successful colonial service, he died in combat at Adwa, and was posthumously awarded the Gold Medal of Military Valour.. Born in Savigliano on 26 April 1846, Arimondi attended the Royal Military Academy in Modena.

Ethiopia managed to defeat the invading Italian force led by Oreste Baratieri on Sunday, March 1, 1896 near the town of Adwa. The decisive victory thwarted the campaign of the Kingdom of Italy to expand its colonial empire in the Horn of Africa.[3] By the end of the 19th century, European powers had carved up almost all of Africa after the Berlin Conference; only Ethiopia and Liberia still maintained their independence.[4] Adwa became a pre-eminent symbol of pan-Africanism and secured Ethiopian sovereignty until the Second Italo-Ethiopian War forty years later.[5]. In 1889, the Italians signed the Treaty of Wuchale with King Menelik of Shewa. The treaty, signed after the Italian occupation of Eritrea, recognized Italy's claim over the coastal colony.\nThought 3: The Battle of Adwa was the climactic battle of the First Italo-Ethiopian War.

His refusal to identify a confidential source led to a landmark court case. During a career-long emphasis on media improvement, he served on the Twentieth Century Fund's task force that established a National News Council, consulted for several foundations, served as secretary of New York Governor Nelson Rockefeller's Committee on the Employment of Minority Groups in the News Media, and produced a film, That the People Shall Know: The Challenge of Journalism, narrated by Walter Cronkite. He wrote and co-authored books on a variety of topics, ranging from the tax exempt status of religious organizations to globalization to the history of radio.[1].

A member of the Republican Party and the wealthy Rockefeller family, he previously served as the 49th governor of New York from 1959 to 1973. Rockefeller also served as assistant secretary of State for American Republic Affairs for Presidents Franklin D. Roosevelt and Harry S.

Originally, the vice president was the person who received the second-most votes for president in the Electoral College. But after the election of 1800 produced a tie between Thomas Jefferson and Aaron Burr, requiring the House of Representatives to choose between them, lawmakers acted to prevent such a situation from recurring. The Twelfth Amendment was added to the Constitution in 1804, creating the current system where electors cast a separate ballot for the vice presidency.[1]. The vice president is the first person in the presidential line of succession\u2014that is, they assume the presidency if the president dies, resigns, or is impeached and removed from office.[2] Nine vice presidents have ascended to the presidency in this way: eight (John Tyler, Millard Fillmore, Andrew Johnson, Chester A.\nThought 6: The search for a list of vice presidents did not provide the specific information I need.

However, 'Dirleton Castle' was suggested as a similar search. Since the question is about a medieval fortress in Dirleton, it's likely that Dirleton Castle is the fortress in question. I will search for Dirleton Castle to gather more information.\nAction 2: Search[Dirleton Castle]\nObservation 2: Dirleton Castle is a medieval fortress in the village of Dirleton, East Lothian, Scotland. It lies around 2 miles (3.2\u00a0km) west of North Berwick, and around 19 miles (31\u00a0km) east of Edinburgh. The oldest parts of the castle date to the 13th century, and it was abandoned by the end of the 17th century.. Begun in around 1240 by John De Vaux, the castle was heavily damaged during the Wars of Scottish Independence, when it was twice taken by the English. In the 14th century, Dirleton was repaired by the Haliburton family, and it was acquired by the Ruthvens in 1505.\nThought 3: The information about Dirleton Castle confirms that it is a medieval fortress in Dirleton, East Lothian, Scotland.

It is situated on the south shore of the Firth of Forth, approximately 20 miles (32\u00a0km) east-northeast of Edinburgh. North Berwick became a fashionable holiday resort in the nineteenth century because of its two sandy bays, the East (or Milsey) Bay and the West Bay, and continues to attract holidaymakers. Golf courses at the ends of each bay are open to visitors.. The name Berwick means \"barley farmstead\" (bere in Old English means \"barley\" and wic means \"farmstead\").\nThought 4: North Berwick is a seaside town situated on the south shore of the Firth of Forth.

Her second studio album, Halcyon (2012), was preceded by the lead single \"Anything Could Happen\"; a repackaged edition of Halcyon, titled Halcyon Days (2013), produced the single \"Burn\", which became her first No.\u20091 single in the UK. She then collaborated with DJ Calvin Harris on two singles: \"I Need Your Love\" and \"Outside\".. After the release of her third studio album, Delirium (2015), and its lead single \"On My Mind\", Goulding earned a Grammy Award nomination for her single \"Love Me like You Do\", which was recorded for the soundtrack of Fifty Shades of Grey (2015).[2] She subsequently took a hiatus from 2016 to 2020, struggling with an anxiety disorder and media scrutinity over false claims on her personal life.[3][4] Her fourth studio album, Brightest Blue (2020), became her third album to top the UK Albums Chart, and her fourth consecutive RIAA\u2013certified album.\nThought 2: Ellie Goulding is an English singer and songwriter who has released multiple successful albums.

I will search for this term to gather more information.\nAction 1: Search[D1NZ]\nObservation 1: D1NZ is a production car drifting series in New Zealand, a sanctioned championship under Motorsport New Zealand, the official FIA appointed governing body of motor-racing in New Zealand.[1] It began early in 2003 as a small competition consisting of several drifting teams from all over the country in order to organise and regulate Drifting events in the country. Since then it has continued to grow larger and more professional, now involving professional teams and internationally ranked drivers.. The series consists of two national title competitions, the D1NZ Pro Championship[2] and the D1NZ Pro-Sport Series.[3] New competitors generally need to prove themselves in the Pro-Sport Series before progressing into the pro class, unless competing with an equivalent international licence. Organizers aim to promote and educate Drifting in New Zealand, with a regulated safe environment. Despite similar moniker, the series is not related to the Japanese D1 Grand Prix series.\nThought 2: The D1NZ series is a production car drifting series in New Zealand. It's a sanctioned championship under Motorsport New Zealand, which is the official FIA appointed governing body of motor-racing in New Zealand. The series began in 2003 and has grown to include professional teams and internationally ranked drivers. It consists of two national title competitions, the D1NZ Pro Championship and the D1NZ Pro-Sport Series. Now that I know what the D1NZ series is, I need to understand what oversteering is.\nAction 2: Search[Oversteering]\nObservation 2: Understeer and oversteer are vehicle dynamics terms used to describe the sensitivity of the vehicle to changes in steering angle associated with changes in lateral acceleration. This sensitivity is defined for a level road for a given steady state operating condition by the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) in document J670[1] and by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) in document 8855.[2]  Whether the vehicle is understeer or oversteer depends on the rate of change of the understeer angle. The Understeer Angle is the amount of additional steering (at the road wheels, not the hand wheel) that must be added in any given steady-state maneuver beyond the Ackermann steer angle. The Ackermann Steer Angle is the steer angle at which the vehicle would travel about a curve when there is no lateral acceleration required (at negligibly low speed).. The Understeer Gradient (U) is the rate of change of the understeer angle with respect to lateral acceleration on a level road for a given steady state operating condition..\nThought 3: Oversteer is a vehicle dynamics term used to describe the sensitivity of a vehicle to changes in steering angle associated with changes in lateral acceleration. It's defined by the Society of Automotive Engineers and the International Organization for Standardization. Whether a vehicle is understeer or oversteer depends on the rate of change of the understeer angle. Now that I understand what oversteering is, I need to find out what specific oversteering technique the D1NZ series is based on. Since D1NZ is a drifting series, it's likely that the oversteering technique it's based on is drifting. I'll search for drifting to confirm this.\nAction 3: Search[Drifting]\nObservation 3: Could not find [Drifting]. Similar: ['Drifting', 'Drifting (motorsport)', 'Drift', 'Single-bamboo drifting', 'Drifting Home'].\nThought 4: I couldn't find the exact term \"Drifting\", but \"Drifting (motorsport)\" seems to be the most relevant to the D1NZ series. I'll search for this term to confirm if it's the oversteering technique the series is based on.\nAction 4: Search[Drifting (motorsport)]\nObservation 4: Drifting is a driving technique where the driver intentionally oversteers, with loss of traction, while maintaining control and driving the car through the entirety of a corner or a turn. The technique causes the rear slip angle to exceed the front slip angle to such an extent that often the front wheels are pointing in the opposite direction to the turn (e.g. car is turning left, wheels are pointed right or vice versa, also known as opposite lock or counter-steering). Drifting is traditionally performed using three methods: clutch kicking (where the clutch is rapidly disengaged and re-engaged with the intention of upsetting the grip of the rear wheels), weight transfer (using techniques such as the Scandinavian flick), and employing a handbrake turn. This sense of drift is not to be confused with the four wheel drift, a classic cornering technique established in Grand Prix and sports car racing.[citation needed].\nThought 5: Drifting is a driving technique where the driver intentionally oversteers, with loss of traction, while maintaining control and driving the car through the entirety of a corner or a turn. This technique causes the rear slip angle to exceed the front slip angle to such an extent that often the front wheels are pointing in the opposite direction to the turn. This confirms that the oversteering technique the D1NZ series is based on is indeed drifting.\nAction 5: Finish[Drifting]\nObservation 5: Episode finished, reward = 1\n\n"}, {"steps": 4, "answer": "Keith Bostic is younger than Jerry Glanville.", "gt_answer": "Keith Bostic", "question_idx": 57, "reward": false, "em": false, "f1": 0.4444444444444445, "n_calls": 5, "n_badcalls": 1, "traj": "Question:\nQuestion: who is younger Keith Bostic or Jerry Glanville ?\nAnalysis:\n```json\n{\n  \"Key components\": \"The key components in this problem are the ages of Keith Bostic and Jerry Glanville.

Some species develop flattened, spreading heads at maturity, while certain variants may manifest as shrubs, standing at less than 6 metres (20\u00a0ft). The bark of cypress trees varies, with some species having smooth surfaces, while most exhibit bark that separates into thin plates or strips, often shedding over time.\nThought 4: The observation indicates that Cypress is a common name for various coniferous trees or shrubs from the Cupressus genus.

Reid to the San Antonio Spurs in exchange for Sidney Green in December,[10][11][12] and released Tom Hammonds to free agency as he later on signed with the Denver Nuggets.[13][14][15] With the addition of Mourning, along with second-year star Larry Johnson and Muggsy Bogues, the Hornets struggled losing four of their first six games, but then went on a five-game winning streak afterwards, held a 26\u201323 record at the All-Star break,[16] and won 9 of their final 12 games, finishing their season third in the Central Division with a 44\u201338 record,[17] and qualified for their first ever playoff appearance.[18][19].

I will search for the \"Teen Titans\" series on Wikipedia to find out which character Tara Strong voiced.\nAction 2: Search[Teen Titans]\nObservation 2: The Teen Titans are a superhero team appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics, frequently in eponymous monthly series. As the group's name indicates, the members are teenage superheroes, many of whom have acted as sidekicks to DC's premier superheroes in the Justice League. The original team later becomes known as the Titans when the members age out of their teenage years, while the Teen Titans name is continued by subsequent generations of young heroes. First appearing in 1964 in The Brave and the Bold #54, the team was formed by Kid Flash (Wally West), Robin (Dick Grayson), and Aqualad (Garth) before adopting the name Teen Titans in issue 60 with the addition of Wonder Girl (Donna Troy) to their ranks.[1]. Over the decades, DC has cancelled and relaunched Teen Titans many times, and a variety of characters have been featured heroes in its pages.\nThought 3: The observation provides information about the Teen Titans team in the comic books, but it does not mention the animated series or the voice actors. I need to find information specifically about the \"Teen Titans\" animated series to find out which character Tara Strong voiced.

Based on DC Comics's superhero team Teen Titans, it was produced by Warner Bros. Animation, and DC Entertainment (for season 5). The show premiered on Cartoon Network on July 19, 2003; its first two seasons also aired on Kids' WB.

However, the list of similar results suggests \"Teen Titans (TV series)\" and \"Teen Titans Go!\". Since \"Teen Titans Go!\" is a spin-off of the original series, it's possible that Tara Strong voiced the same character in both series. I will search for \"Teen Titans Go!\" to see if it provides information about the voice cast.\nAction 6: Search[Teen Titans Go!]\nObservation 6: Teen Titans Go! is an American animated television series developed by Aaron Horvath and Michael Jelenic for Cartoon Network. It premiered on April 23, 2013, and is based on DC Comics' fictional superhero team the Teen Titans. The series was announced following the popularity of DC Nation's New Teen Titans shorts.[2] The production companies of the series are DC Entertainment and Warner Bros. Animation, with the animation outsourced to Canada at Copernicus Studios and Bardel Entertainment.[3]. Sporting a different animation style, Teen Titans Go! serves as a comedic standalone spin-off with little to no continuity to the original Teen Titans series (although some references are included as comedic fan service) or any other media in the DC Comics franchise.\nThought 7: The observation provides information about the \"Teen Titans Go!\" series, but it does not mention the voice actors or the characters they voiced.

I know that \"Oranje\" translates to \"Orange\" in English, and that orange is a significant color in Dutch culture, often associated with the Dutch Royal Family, which belongs to the House of Orange-Nassau. Therefore, it's likely that the color worn during these celebrations is orange. However, I should confirm this information to provide an accurate answer. \nAction 1: Search[Oranjegekte]\nObservation 1: Oranjegekte (Orange craze) or Oranjekoorts (Orange fever) is a phenomenon in the Netherlands that occurs during major sporting events, especially international football championships, Formula One Grands Prix and during Koningsdag, an annual holiday celebrating the king's birthday. It manifests itself in the wearing of orange clothing such as T-shirts, caps and scarfs; lavish attention for sports and sports fans in the media; and the decoration of cars,[1] rooms, houses, shops, and even entire streets in orange,[2] the traditional colour of the Dutch royal family, the House of Orange-Nassau.. Oranjegekte was initially confined to a few days in the year reserved for celebrations of the monarchy, until it expanded to include sports events.[3] Festivities were usually organized at the local level by neighborhood associations and Oranjeverenigingen (\"Orange associations\") and supported financially by the government. Notable events include the January 1937 wedding between Juliana of the Netherlands, then the Dutch crown princess, and Bernhard of Lippe-Biesterfeld; in Emmen and other places festivities lasted until the start of World War II.[4]. In 1934 Oranjegekte in relation to sports became a phenomenon remarked on in the Dutch media when during the 1934 FIFA World Cup in Italy, thousands of supporters (though not yet orange-clad) traveled to Italy and crowded the boulevards, some dressed in the traditional garb of Volendam (according to De Telegraaf), singing \"We gaan naar Rome toe\" (\"We're going to Rome\").\nThought 2: The information confirms that during Oranjegekte, people in the Netherlands wear orange clothing such as T-shirts, caps, and scarfs. This tradition is linked to the color of the Dutch royal family, the House of Orange-Nassau. Now, I should verify if the same applies to the Koningsdag celebration.\nAction 2: Search[Koningsdag]\nObservation 2: Koningsdag (Dutch pronunciation: [\u02c8ko\u02d0n\u026a\u014bzd\u0251x] \u24d8) or King's Day is a national holiday in the Kingdom of the Netherlands. Celebrated on 27 April (26 April if the 27th is a Sunday), the date marks the birth of King Willem-Alexander.[1] When the Dutch monarch is female, the holiday is known as Koninginnedag (Dutch pronunciation: [\u02ccko\u02d0n\u026a\u014b\u02c8\u026an\u0259d\u0251x] \u24d8) or Queen's Day and, under Queen Beatrix until 2013, was celebrated on 30 April. She prolonged the tradition that was born under her mother\u2019s reign: Queen Juliana\u2019s (Queen of The Netherlands from 1948 till 1980) birthday was on April 30th.. The holiday was initially observed on 31 August 1885 as Prinsessedag or Princess's Day, the fifth birthday of Princess Wilhelmina, then heir presumptive to the Dutch throne. On her accession in November 1890 the holiday acquired the name Koninginnedag, first celebrated on 31 August 1891.\nThought 3: The information about Koningsdag doesn't mention the color of clothing worn during the celebration. However, since it's a national holiday celebrating the king's birthday and is linked to the monarchy, it's likely that the color orange is also significant during this event, similar to Oranjegekte. I should look for more information to confirm this.\nAction 3: Lookup[orange]\nObservation 3: (Result 1 / 9) It is also an opportunity for \"orange madness\" or oranjegekte, a kind of frenzy named for the national colour..\nThought 4: The information confirms that \"orange madness\" or oranjegekte, which involves wearing the color orange, is also a part of the Koningsdag celebration. This aligns with the tradition during Oranjegekte. Now, I can provide an answer to the question.\nAction 4: Finish[During the Oranjegekte and Koningsdag celebrations in the Netherlands, people traditionally wear orange clothing.

His areas of specialty are the People's Republic of China[4] and the North Korean nuclear weapons program..

The company was headquartered in Northfield, Illinois, near Chicago.. Kraft was listed on the New York Stock Exchange and became a component of the Dow Jones Industrial Average on September 22, 2008, replacing the American International Group.[7] In August 2011, the company announced plans to split into a North American grocery products business and a faster-growing global snacks company.[8] The snack company, Mondelez International Inc.\nThought 4: Kraft Foods Inc. is a multinational confectionery, food, and beverage conglomerate based in Illinois, which matches the description in the question. However, the passage does not mention Handi-Snacks as one of its products. It's also mentioned that Kraft Foods split into a North American grocery products business and a global snacks company, Mondelez International Inc.

The national park is centered on Mount Teide, the highest mountain of Spain (3,718 meters high) in addition, the highest volcano in the Atlantic Ocean  islands and the third highest volcano in the world from its base in the ocean floor (7.500 meters high). Pico Viejo, also included within the national park limits, is the second highest volcano in the Canary Islands with its 3,135 m peak. Mount Teide and Pico Viejo are the only two peaks in the Canary islands rising above the 3,000 m level.[1]. The park has an area of 18,990 hectares located in the municipality of La Orotava.[2] It was named a World Heritage Site by UNESCO on June 28, 2007.[3] Since the end of 2007, it has also been one of the 12 Treasures of Spain.\nThought 2: Teide National Park is located in Tenerife, Canary Islands, Spain.

He was previously editor-in-chief of Melbourne'sThe Age, editor of London's The Observer, The Sunday Times Scotland (Glasgow), Scotland on Sunday (Edinburgh), The Scotsman Edinburgh), and Sunday Herald (Glasgow), and publisher and managing editor of The Big Issue London.. Jaspan was born in Manchester and lived in Australia between the ages of seven and fourteen.[1] He completed his Bachelor of Arts in Politics, Modern History and Philosophy from the University of Manchester.[2]  He did his thesis on \"The Role of the BBC in UK politics\".. After graduating, Jaspan launched The New Manchester Review magazine which focussed on news, investigations and arts and culture.[3] To help fund the magazine, Jaspan ran Monday night concerts at the Band on the Wall pub between 1977\u20139, showcasing punk bands (including Joy Division, The Buzzcocks, and The Fall) as well as poets (including John Cooper Clark and Adrian Henri).[3] He then started work in the Manchester office of The Daily Telegraph and Daily Mirror in 1980.[1].\nThought 2: The observation mentions that Andrew Jaspan is the founder of The Conversation. Given that this is a media outlet and the only one mentioned in the context of him being a founder, it is likely that The Conversation is the not-for-profit media outlet the question is referring to.

Hackman portrays a surveillance expert who faces a moral dilemma when his recordings reveal a potential murder.. The Conversation premiered at the 1974 Cannes Film Festival, where it won the Grand Prix du Festival International du Film, the festival's highest prize, and was released theatrically on April 7, 1974, by Paramount Pictures to critical acclaim but box office disappointment, grossing $4.4 million on a $1.6 million budget. The film received three nominations at the 47th Academy Awards: Best Picture, Best Original Screenplay, and Best Sound.. In 1995, it was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".[2].\nThought 3: The search result for \"The Conversation\" returned information about a film, not a media outlet.
