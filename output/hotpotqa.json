The mosque was commissioned by Sultan Mustafa III to serve as his imperial or sultanic mosque.[2][3] Although it was tradition among earlier sultans to build their imperial mosque in commemoration of a major military success, Mustafa III ignored this tradition by ordering the construction before any such victories.[3] Construction began on 5 April 1760 and was completed on 9 March 1764.[4][3] According to a contemporary writer, the mosque was officially named Nur Mustafa ('Light of Mustafa'), but it became popularly known as the Laleli Mosque ('Mosque of the Tulips') after the name of the neighbourhood where it was built.[3]. The architect of the mosque is not confirmed by historical documentation, but art historians have attributed the mosque to Mehmed Tahir Agha, the chief imperial architect at the time of the mosque's completion.[a][2][4][5] On average, about 770 workers were employed in the project and about two thirds of them were non-Muslims, the rest being Muslim.[5]. The mosque was the centerpiece of a larger complex (k\u00fclliye) that included the Mustafa III's tomb, a nearby caravanserai which provided some revenues to the complex, a sebil, and a madrasa.[6] Mustafa III was buried in the mausoleum attached to the complex after his death in 1774.[7] The mosque and its complex were damaged by the 1766 earthquake[4] and, according to \u00dcnver R\u00fcstem, by a fire in 1783.[7] In 1783 it was fully restored.[7][2] The restoration, which Do\u011fan Kuban attributes to the architect Seyit Mustafa Agha,[4][2] preserved the original mosque's appearance.[7] The mausoleum's fa\u00e7ade was updated with new marble window frames in the early 19th century.[6] The madrasa of the complex was destroyed by fire in 1911.[6]. The mosque was built in the Ottoman Baroque style of its time.[8][9][10] The layout is based on that of the earlier Selimiye Mosque of Edirne from the classical period, in accordance with Mustafa III's wishes.[11][5] The decoration of the mosque and its complex is firmly baroque.[12][2] The mosque incorporates thus the visual style of the earlier Nuruosmaniye Mosque \u2013 the first imperial mosque in the Ottoman Baroque style, completed by Mustafa III's predecessor \u2013 but in a more restrained way that integrates it with more traditional Ottoman architecture.[13].\nThought 2: Laleli Mosque is located in Laleli, Fatih, Istanbul, Turkey.

Featuring members of underground Lincoln bands Cartoon Pupils and Hymn to Joy, the band first called itself Glue, and then D.B.L., finally settling on Four Against One,[1] a name that reflected its status as a quintet at the time. Bassist Liz Panarelli's early departure gave way to keyboardist Jeffrey Runnings' shift to bass, as well as the band's truncation of its name to For Against.\nThought 4: For Against is an American post-punk/dream pop band from Lincoln, Nebraska.

The term \"Great Plains\", for the region west of about the 96th or 98th meridian and east of the Rocky Mountains, was not generally used before the early 20th century. Nevin Fenneman's 1916 study, Physiographic Subdivision of the United States,[6] brought the term Great Plains into more widespread usage. Prior to 1916, the region was almost invariably called the High Plains, in contrast to the lower Prairie Plains of the Midwestern states.[7] Today the term \"High Plains\" is usually used for a subregion instead of the whole of the Great Plains..\nThought 7: The High Plains rise in elevation from around 1,800 to 7,000 ft.

Roth was born in Tysmenitz near Stanislawow, Galicia, Austro-Hungary (now known as Tysmenytsia, near Ivano-Frankivsk, Galicia, Ukraine).[1] Although his parents never agreed on the exact date of his arrival in the United States, it is most likely that he and his mother landed at Ellis Island and began his life in New York in 1908. The family briefly lived in Brooklyn, and then on the Lower East Side, in the slums where his classic novel Call It Sleep is set. In 1914, they moved to Harlem.

As a firm believer in the British Empire, Childers served as a volunteer in the army expeditionary force in the Second Boer War in South Africa, but his experiences there began a gradual process of disillusionment with British imperialism. He was adopted as a candidate in British parliamentary elections, standing for the Liberal Party at a time when the party supported a treaty to establish Irish home rule, but he later became an advocate of Irish republicanism and the severance of all ties with Britain. On behalf of the Irish Volunteers, he smuggled guns into Ireland later used against British soldiers in the Easter Rebellion.

A chance meeting with Andy Votel at the Generation X bar in Manchester, where Gough's friends Scott Abraham and Damon Hayhurst were contributing to an exhibition by the Space Monkey Clothing Company and Votel was DJing, led to the foundation of Twisted Nerve Records.. In 2002, Q magazine named Badly Drawn Boy in their list of the \"50 Bands to See Before You Die\", although this was as part of a sub-list of \"5 Bands That Could Go Either Way\" on account of Gough's tendency to talk and tell stories for extended periods in concert rather than play songs..\nThought 2: Badly Drawn Boy is a single person who is a multi-instrumentalist.

The sole species, Dictyosperma album, is widely cultivated in the tropics but has been farmed to near extinction in its native habitat.[3] It is commonly called princess palm or hurricane palm, the latter owing to its ability to withstand strong winds by easily shedding leaves.[4] It is closely related to, and resembles, palms in the genus Archontophoenix.[4] The genus is named from two Greek words meaning \"net\" and \"seed\" and the epithet is Latin for \"white\", the common color of the crownshaft at the top of the trunk.. The ringed trunks are solitary at 15\u00a0cm in diameter with a slight bulge at the base, occasionally reaching up to 12 m in height. The crownshaft is over a meter tall, swollen at the base, and covered in white wax\u2014 which has given the palm its epithet album\u2014 and small, matted brown hairs, producing a rounded leaf crown 4.5 m wide and 3 m tall. The 2.5 to 3 m leaves are borne on short 30\u00a0cm petioles; the arching leaflets are pointed at the apice, from 60 \u2013 90\u00a0cm, dark green in color, and emerge from the rachis in a single plane..\nThought 2: Dictyosperma is classified as a genus.

The flowers are five-lobed, usually somewhat more funnel- or bell-shaped than in the closely related genus Stapelia, and often striped vividly in contrasting colors or tones, some glossy, others matte and wrinkled depending on the species concerned. Frequently the flowers are colored a variation of red, yellow or brown.[5] To pollinate, the flowers attract flies by emitting a scent similar to that of carrion. The genus is considered close to the genera Stapelia and Hoodia. Phylogenetic studies have shown the genus to be monophyletic, and most closely related to the genus Tavaresia, and to a widespread branch of stapeliads comprising the genera Orbea, Piaranthus and Stapelia.[6].\nThought 5: Huernia is classified as a genus.

Identify Key Components: The main elements of the problem are Euromarch\u00e9, the chain that bought it in 1991, and the number of hypermarkets this chain operated at the end of 2016.\n\n2. Relationship between Components: Euromarch\u00e9 was bought by a certain chain in 1991. This chain then presumably expanded or continued to operate a number of hypermarkets. The relationship between these components is a chronological and business one, with the purchase of Euromarch\u00e9 being a key event.\n\n3. Clarify the Question: The question is asking for the number of hypermarkets that the chain, which bought Euromarch\u00e9 in 1991, was operating at the end of 2016.\n\n4.

The first store opened in 1968 in Saint-Michel-sur-Orge. In June 1991, the group was rebought by its rival, Carrefour, for 5,2 billion francs.. In June 1991, there were 77 Euromarch\u00e9 hypermarkets, 47 DIY stores Bricorama, and 57 caf\u00e9t\u00e9rias Eris. Sandra Mackey, author of The Saudis: Inside the Desert Kingdom, said in 1987 that it was \"the French equivalent of K-Mart.\"[1].\nThought 2: Carrefour bought Euromarch\u00e9 in 1991.

I should try searching for \"Central Plains orogeny\" instead, as it was mentioned in the previous observation as the name for the eastern sector.\nAction 4: Search[Central Plains orogeny]\nObservation 4: The Central Plains orogeny was a mountain building event in the Proterozoic from 1630 to 1800 million years ago, preserved in the subsurface of Nebraska, Kansas, and Missouri, US.[1] The event is closely related to the Yavapai orogeny and may have had the same underlying causes.[2]. The orogen is over 1,000 kilometers (620\u00a0mi) long and at least 500 kilometers (310\u00a0mi) in width. It consists of granitic and metamorphic rock ranging in age from 1,630 to 1,800 million years in age, and is regarded as an extension of the fold belt of similar age in Colorado and southeastern Wyoming. It truncates the Penokean and Trans-Hudson orogenic belts of the Archean Superior province, which are 1830 to 1950 million years in age.[1]. The orogen has been interpreted as part of the Yavapai orogeny, which welded a set of island arcs to the margin of Laurentia (the ancient core of North America) between 1780 and 1680 million years ago.[2].\nThought 5: The Central Plains orogeny does not provide information about its elevation. I should try searching for \"High Plains\" instead, as it was mentioned in the previous observation as the area into which the eastern sector extends.\nAction 5: Search[High Plains]\nObservation 5: High Plains refers to either of two distinct land regions:.

I need to search for \"High Plains (United States)\" to get more specific information.\nAction 6: Search[High Plains (United States)]\nObservation 6: The High Plains are a subregion of the Great Plains, mainly in the Western United States, but also partly in the Midwest states of Nebraska, Kansas, and South Dakota, generally encompassing the western part of the Great Plains before the region reaches the Rocky Mountains. The High Plains are located in eastern Montana, southeastern Wyoming, southwestern South Dakota, western Nebraska, eastern Colorado, western Kansas, eastern New Mexico, the Oklahoma Panhandle, and the Texas Panhandle.[4] The southern region of the Western High Plains ecology region contains the geological formation known as Llano Estacado which can be seen from a short distance or on satellite maps.[5] From east to west, the High Plains rise in elevation from around 1,800 to 7,000\u00a0ft (550 to 2,130\u00a0m).[3]. The term \"Great Plains\", for the region west of about the 96th or 98th meridian and east of the Rocky Mountains, was not generally used before the early 20th century. Nevin Fenneman's 1916 study, Physiographic Subdivision of the United States,[6] brought the term Great Plains into more widespread usage. Prior to 1916, the region was almost invariably called the High Plains, in contrast to the lower Prairie Plains of the Midwestern states.[7] Today the term \"High Plains\" is usually used for a subregion instead of the whole of the Great Plains..\nThought 7: The High Plains rise in elevation from around 1,800 to 7,000 ft. So the elevation range for the area that the eastern sector of the Colorado orogeny extends into is 1,800 to 7,000 ft.\nAction 7: Finish[1,800 to 7,000 ft]\nObservation 7: Episode finished, reward = 0\n\n", "question": "Question: In 1991 Euromarch\u00e9 was bought by a chain that operated how any hypermarkets at the end of 2016?"}, {"steps": 7, "answer": "Indianapolis 500", "gt_answer": "Indianapolis Motor Speedway", "question_idx": 52, "reward": false, "em": false, "f1": 0.4, "n_calls": 9, "n_badcalls": 2, "traj": "Solve a question answering task with interleaving Thought, Action, Observation steps.

The story features the adventures of young Charlie Bucket inside the chocolate factory of eccentric chocolatier Willy Wonka.[1]. The story was originally inspired by Roald Dahl's experience of chocolate companies during his schooldays at Repton School in Derbyshire. Cadbury would often send test packages to the schoolchildren in exchange for their opinions on the new products.[2] At that time (around the 1920s), Cadbury and Rowntree's were England's two largest chocolate makers and they each often tried to steal trade secrets by sending spies, posing as employees, into the other's factory\u2014inspiring Dahl's idea for the recipe-thieving spies (such as Wonka's rival Slugworth) depicted in the book.[3] Because of this, both companies became highly protective of their chocolate-making processes. It was a combination of this secrecy and the elaborate, often gigantic, machines in the factory that inspired Dahl to write the story.[4].\nThought 6: \"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\" could be considered a variation on a popular anecdote of a child winning a golden ticket to visit a mysterious candy factory.
