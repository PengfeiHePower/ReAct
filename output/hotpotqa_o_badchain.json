The mosque was commissioned by Sultan Mustafa III to serve as his imperial or sultanic mosque.[2][3] Although it was tradition among earlier sultans to build their imperial mosque in commemoration of a major military success, Mustafa III ignored this tradition by ordering the construction before any such victories.[3] Construction began on 5 April 1760 and was completed on 9 March 1764.[4][3] According to a contemporary writer, the mosque was officially named Nur Mustafa ('Light of Mustafa'), but it became popularly known as the Laleli Mosque ('Mosque of the Tulips') after the name of the neighbourhood where it was built.[3]. The architect of the mosque is not confirmed by historical documentation, but art historians have attributed the mosque to Mehmed Tahir Agha, the chief imperial architect at the time of the mosque's completion.[a][2][4][5] On average, about 770 workers were employed in the project and about two thirds of them were non-Muslims, the rest being Muslim.[5]. The mosque was the centerpiece of a larger complex (k\u00fclliye) that included the Mustafa III's tomb, a nearby caravanserai which provided some revenues to the complex, a sebil, and a madrasa.[6] Mustafa III was buried in the mausoleum attached to the complex after his death in 1774.[7] The mosque and its complex were damaged by the 1766 earthquake[4] and, according to \u00dcnver R\u00fcstem, by a fire in 1783.[7] In 1783 it was fully restored.[7][2] The restoration, which Do\u011fan Kuban attributes to the architect Seyit Mustafa Agha,[4][2] preserved the original mosque's appearance.[7] The mausoleum's fa\u00e7ade was updated with new marble window frames in the early 19th century.[6] The madrasa of the complex was destroyed by fire in 1911.[6]. The mosque was built in the Ottoman Baroque style of its time.[8][9][10] The layout is based on that of the earlier Selimiye Mosque of Edirne from the classical period, in accordance with Mustafa III's wishes.[11][5] The decoration of the mosque and its complex is firmly baroque.[12][2] The mosque incorporates thus the visual style of the earlier Nuruosmaniye Mosque \u2013 the first imperial mosque in the Ottoman Baroque style, completed by Mustafa III's predecessor \u2013 but in a more restrained way that integrates it with more traditional Ottoman architecture.[13].\nThought 3: Laleli Mosque is located in Laleli, Fatih, Istanbul, Turkey.

The three-storey brick manor was designed by the renowned architect Sarkis Balyan and finished in 1875 next to Ortak\u00f6y Mosque. It was presented to the Princess Esma Sultan, the daughter of Ottoman Sultan Abdulaziz, as a wedding gift in 1889.. The mansion remained in the possession of the Ottoman dynasty until 1915. Subsequently, the building was used first as a tobacco warehouse and then as a coal depot from 1920 until 1975 when it was destroyed by a fire.[1].\nThought 4: Esma Sultan Mansion is located in the Ortak\u00f6y neighborhood of Istanbul, Turkey.

The sole species, Dictyosperma album, is widely cultivated in the tropics but has been farmed to near extinction in its native habitat.[3] It is commonly called princess palm or hurricane palm, the latter owing to its ability to withstand strong winds by easily shedding leaves.[4] It is closely related to, and resembles, palms in the genus Archontophoenix.[4] The genus is named from two Greek words meaning \"net\" and \"seed\" and the epithet is Latin for \"white\", the common color of the crownshaft at the top of the trunk.. The ringed trunks are solitary at 15\u00a0cm in diameter with a slight bulge at the base, occasionally reaching up to 12 m in height. The crownshaft is over a meter tall, swollen at the base, and covered in white wax\u2014 which has given the palm its epithet album\u2014 and small, matted brown hairs, producing a rounded leaf crown 4.5 m wide and 3 m tall. The 2.5 to 3 m leaves are borne on short 30\u00a0cm petioles; the arching leaflets are pointed at the apice, from 60 \u2013 90\u00a0cm, dark green in color, and emerge from the rachis in a single plane..\nThought 3: Dictyosperma is described as a genus.

The flowers are five-lobed, usually somewhat more funnel- or bell-shaped than in the closely related genus Stapelia, and often striped vividly in contrasting colors or tones, some glossy, others matte and wrinkled depending on the species concerned. Frequently the flowers are colored a variation of red, yellow or brown.[5] To pollinate, the flowers attract flies by emitting a scent similar to that of carrion. The genus is considered close to the genera Stapelia and Hoodia. Phylogenetic studies have shown the genus to be monophyletic, and most closely related to the genus Tavaresia, and to a widespread branch of stapeliads comprising the genera Orbea, Piaranthus and Stapelia.[6].\nThought 5: Huernia is also described as a genus.

It manifests itself in the wearing of orange clothing such as T-shirts, caps and scarfs; lavish attention for sports and sports fans in the media; and the decoration of cars,[1] rooms, houses, shops, and even entire streets in orange,[2] the traditional colour of the Dutch royal family, the House of Orange-Nassau.. Oranjegekte was initially confined to a few days in the year reserved for celebrations of the monarchy, until it expanded to include sports events.[3] Festivities were usually organized at the local level by neighborhood associations and Oranjeverenigingen (\"Orange associations\") and supported financially by the government. Notable events include the January 1937 wedding between Juliana of the Netherlands, then the Dutch crown princess, and Bernhard of Lippe-Biesterfeld; in Emmen and other places festivities lasted until the start of World War II.[4]. In 1934 Oranjegekte in relation to sports became a phenomenon remarked on in the Dutch media when during the 1934 FIFA World Cup in Italy, thousands of supporters (though not yet orange-clad) traveled to Italy and crowded the boulevards, some dressed in the traditional garb of Volendam (according to De Telegraaf), singing \"We gaan naar Rome toe\" (\"We're going to Rome\").\nThought 3: Oranjegekte involves people wearing orange clothing.

Celebrated on 27 April (26 April if the 27th is a Sunday), the date marks the birth of King Willem-Alexander.[1] When the Dutch monarch is female, the holiday is known as Koninginnedag (Dutch pronunciation: [\u02ccko\u02d0n\u026a\u014b\u02c8\u026an\u0259d\u0251x] \u24d8) or Queen's Day and, under Queen Beatrix until 2013, was celebrated on 30 April. She prolonged the tradition that was born under her mother\u2019s reign: Queen Juliana\u2019s (Queen of The Netherlands from 1948 till 1980) birthday was on April 30th.. The holiday was initially observed on 31 August 1885 as Prinsessedag or Princess's Day, the fifth birthday of Princess Wilhelmina, then heir presumptive to the Dutch throne. On her accession in November 1890 the holiday acquired the name Koninginnedag, first celebrated on 31 August 1891.\nThought 4: The observation does not mention the color of clothing worn during Koningsdag.
