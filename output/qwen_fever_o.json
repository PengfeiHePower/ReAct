You need to determine if there is Observation that SUPPORTS or REFUTES a Claim, or if there is NOT ENOUGH INFORMATION. \nClaim: Nikolaj Coster-Waldau worked with the Fox Broadcasting Company.

He graduated from the Danish National School of Performing Arts in Copenhagen in 1993,[1] and had his breakthrough role in Denmark with the film Nightwatch (1994).

The answer is SUPPORTS.\nThought 1: I should search for Stranger Things, and see if it is set in Bloomington, Indiana.\nAction 1: Search[Stranger Things]\nObservation 1: Stranger Things is an American science fiction horror drama television series created by the Duffer Brothers. Set in the 1980s, primarily in the fictional town of Hawkins, Indiana, the series centers on a number of mysteries and supernatural events occurring around the town and their impact on an ensemble of child and adult characters. \nThought 2: The observation says that it is set in a \"fictional town of Hawkins, Indiana\", so it is not set in Bloomington.\nAction 2: Finish[SUPPORTS]\n\nClaim: Beautiful reached number two on the Billboard Hot 100 in 2003.? The answer is SUPPORTS\nThought 1: I need to search the song Beautiful and find if it reached number two on the Billboard Hot 100 in 2003.\nAction 1: Search[Beautiful]\nObservation 1: Could not find [Beautiful]. Similar: ['Beautiful', 'Beautiful, Beautiful', 'A Beautiful Mind (film)', 'Beautiful (Christina Aguilera song)', 'Life Is Beautiful'].\nThought 2: From suggestions, I should search \"Beautiful (Christina Aguilera song)\" to find the song.\nAction 2: Search[Beautiful (Christina Aguilera song)]\nObservation 2: \"Beautiful\" is a song recorded by American singer Christina Aguilera for her fourth studio album, Stripped (2002).\nThought 3: It does not mention Billboard, so I need to look up \"Billboard Hot 100\" to find if it reached number two on it in 2003.\nAction 3: Lookup[Billboard Hot 100]\nObservation 3: (Result 1 / 3) The song peaked at number two on the Billboard Hot 100 in the United States, where it was certified Gold for 500,000 units shipped.\nThought 4: It only says the song peaked at number two on the Billboard Hot 100, but not if it was in 2003.

To find their 63rd season in the NFL, we add 63 years to 1950, which brings us to the 2013 NFL season.\n\nThought 3: The information suggests that Kaepernick became a starting quarterback in the 2012 season, not the 2013 season, which would have been the team's 63rd in the NFL.\n\nAction 3: Finish[REFUTES]\nObservation 1: An error has occurred while searching: Search request is longer than the maximum allowed length.

Therefore, the claim is refuted based on the information provided earlier. The error message observed in Action 3 is irrelevant to the conclusion already derived.\nThought 3: The conclusion stands corrected from the initial\u8bef\u89e3. Colin Kaepernick indeed became a starting quarterback for the 49ers during their 62nd season in the NFL, which contradicts the claim stating it was their 63rd season. Therefore, the appropriate action is to finalize with a REFUTES verdict, acknowledging the accurate historical context.\n\nAction 3: Finish[REFUTES]\nObservation 3: Episode finished, reward = 0\n\n"}]
