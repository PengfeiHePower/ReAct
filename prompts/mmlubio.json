{"react":"\nDetermine which option is correct for the given problem.\n\nQuestion:Short-term changes in plant growth rate mediated by the plant hormone auxin are hypothesized to result from\nOptions:\nA) loss of turgor pressure in the affected cells\nB) increased extensibility of the walls of affected cells\nC) suppression of metabolic activity in affected cells\nD) cytoskeletal rearrangements in the affected cells\nThought 1: I need to search auxin, and find out the effect of auxin on plant cells\nAction 1: Search[auxin]\nObservation 1: Auxin stimulates cell elongation by stimulating wall-loosening factors, such as expansins, to loosen cell walls. The effect is stronger if gibberellins are also present. Auxin also stimulates cell division if cytokinins are present. When auxin and cytokinin are applied to callus, rooting can be generated with higher auxin to cytokinin ratios, shoot growth is induced by lower auxin to cytokinin ratios, and a callus is formed with intermediate ratios, with the exact threshold ratios depending on the species and the original tissue. Auxin also induces sugar and mineral accumulation at the site of application. \nThought 2: Since 'Auxin stimulates cell elongation by stimulating wall-loosening factors, such as expansins, to loosen cell walls', auxin can increase extensibility of the walls of affected cells. Thus the answer is B. \nFinish[B]\n\nQuestion:Hawkmoths are insects that are similar in appearance and behavior to hummingbirds. Which of the following is LEAST valid?\nOptions:\nA) These organisms are examples of convergent evolution.\nB) These organisms were subjected to similar environmental conditions.\nC) These organisms are genetically related to each other.\nD) These organisms have analogous structures.\nThought 1: I need to search for hawkmoths and hummingbirds to find out why they have similar appearence. \nAction 1: Search[hawkmoth] \nObservation 1: Some hawk moths, such as the hummingbird hawk-moth or the white-lined sphinx, hover in midair while they feed on nectar from flowers, so are sometimes mistaken for hummingbirds. This hovering capability is only known to have evolved four times in nectar feeders: in hummingbirds, certain bats, hoverflies, and these sphingids[3] (an example of convergent evolution). Sphingids have been much studied for their flying ability, especially their ability to move rapidly from side to side while hovering, called 'swing-hovering' or 'side-slipping'. This is thought to have evolved to deal with ambush predators that lie in wait in flowers. \nThought 2: Because 'This hovering capability is only known to have evolved four times in nectar feeders: in hummingbirds, certain bats, hoverflies, and these sphingids[3] (an example of convergent evolution)', option A seems to be valid. \nThought 3: Because 'Some hawk moths, such as the hummingbird hawk-moth or the white-lined sphinx, hover in midair while they feed on nectar from flowers', option B and D seems to be correct. \nThought 3: There is no evidence to support option C. \nFinish[C] \n\n"}
