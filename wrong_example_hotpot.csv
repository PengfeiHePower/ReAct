As a firm believer in the British Empire, Childers served as a volunteer in the army expeditionary force in the Second Boer War in South Africa, but his experiences there began a gradual process of disillusionment with British imperialism. He was adopted as a candidate in British parliamentary elections, standing for the Liberal Party at a time when the party supported a treaty to establish Irish home rule, but he later became an advocate of Irish republicanism and the severance of all ties with Britain. On behalf of the Irish Volunteers, he smuggled guns into Ireland later used against British soldiers in the Easter Rebellion.

Gough chose his stage name from a character in the show Sam and the Magic Ball, which he saw on TV at a party in Trafford, Greater Manchester, in 1995. Before he thought of using this name he made some business cards, each one unique, with a printed picture of a drawing by his nephew and a small collage by Gough.. A chance meeting with Andy Votel at the Generation X bar in Manchester, where Gough's friends Scott Abraham and Damon Hayhurst were contributing to an exhibition by the Space Monkey Clothing Company and Votel was DJing, led to the foundation of Twisted Nerve Records.. In 2002, Q magazine named Badly Drawn Boy in their list of the ""50 Bands to See Before You Die"", although this was as part of a sub-list of ""5 Bands That Could Go Either Way"" on account of Gough's tendency to talk and tell stories for extended periods in concert rather than play songs..

Observation 1: Seven Brief Lessons on Physics (Italian: Sette brevi lezioni di fisica) is a short book by the Italian physicist Carlo Rovelli. Originally published in Italian in 2014, by 2021 the book has been translated into 52 languages.[1] More than a million copies have been sold, of which more than 400,000 in Italy.[2]. The book condenses the revelations of post-Newtonian physics – from Einstein's theory of relativity to quantum mechanics – into seven brief, accessible lessons.[3] These were originally serialised in an Italian newspaper.[4] Rovelli uses a literary approach, for instance, highlighting a year Einstein spent apparently aimlessly with the comment that those who don't waste time, won't get anywhere.[5]. The chapters are:. This article about a physics-related book is a stub.

In a state of total war, directly involving more than 100 million personnel from more than 30 countries, the major participants threw their entire economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities behind the war effort, blurring the distinction between civilian and military resources. World War II was the deadliest conflict in human history, resulting in 70 to 85 million fatalities, a majority being civilians. Tens of millions of people died due to genocides (including the Holocaust), premeditated death from starvation, massacres, and disease. Aircraft played a major role in the conflict, enabling the strategic bombing of population centres and the only two uses of nuclear weapons in war.

More recent breeding has focused on the Collie as a show dog, and also companion. The breed specifications call for a distinctive long narrow tapered snout and tipped (semiprick) ears, so some dogs have their ears taped when young. Rough Collies generally come in shades of sable and white (sometimes mahogany), blue merle, tri-coloured, and colour-headed white.. Originating in the 19th century,[1] the breed is now well known through the stories of author Albert Payson Terhune about his dog Lad, and later with Eric Knight's character of Lassie and her novels, movies, and television shows..

2. Relationship between Components: Euromarché was bought by a certain chain in 1991. This chain then presumably expanded or continued to operate a number of hypermarkets. The relationship between these components is a chronological and business one, with the purchase of Euromarché being a key event.

3. Clarify the Question: The question is asking for the number of hypermarkets that the chain, which bought Euromarché in 1991, was operating at the end of 2016.

4. Determine the Scope: The scope of the problem is limited to the chain that bought Euromarché and its operations up until the end of 2016. Any operations beyond this time or by other chains are not relevant to the problem.

5. Break into Sub-questions: The main question can be broken down into the following sub-questions:
   a. Who bought Euromarché in 1991?
   b. How many hypermarkets did this chain operate immediately after the purchase?
   c. How many hypermarkets did this chain operate at the end of 2016?

In June 1991, the group was rebought by its rival, Carrefour, for 5,2 billion francs.. In June 1991, there were 77 Euromarché hypermarkets, 47 DIY stores Bricorama, and 57 cafétérias Eris. Sandra Mackey, author of The Saudis: Inside the Desert Kingdom, said in 1987 that it was ""the French equivalent of K-Mart.""[1].

Thought 4: The search for ""Colorado orogeny eastern sector"" did not yield any results. I should try searching for ""Central Plains orogeny"" instead, as it was mentioned in the previous observation as the name for the eastern sector.
Action 4: Search[Central Plains orogeny]
Observation 4: The Central Plains orogeny was a mountain building event in the Proterozoic from 1630 to 1800 million years ago, preserved in the subsurface of Nebraska, Kansas, and Missouri, US.[1] The event is closely related to the Yavapai orogeny and may have had the same underlying causes.[2]. The orogen is over 1,000 kilometers (620 mi) long and at least 500 kilometers (310 mi) in width. It consists of granitic and metamorphic rock ranging in age from 1,630 to 1,800 million years in age, and is regarded as an extension of the fold belt of similar age in Colorado and southeastern Wyoming. It truncates the Penokean and Trans-Hudson orogenic belts of the Archean Superior province, which are 1830 to 1950 million years in age.[1]. The orogen has been interpreted as part of the Yavapai orogeny, which welded a set of island arcs to the margin of Laurentia (the ancient core of North America) between 1780 and 1680 million years ago.[2].
Thought 5: The Central Plains orogeny does not provide information about its elevation. I should try searching for ""High Plains"" instead, as it was mentioned in the previous observation as the area into which the eastern sector extends.

Thought 6: The search for ""High Plains"" returned two distinct land regions, but it does not specify what they are. I need to search for ""High Plains (United States)"" to get more specific information.
Action 6: Search[High Plains (United States)]
Observation 6: The High Plains are a subregion of the Great Plains, mainly in the Western United States, but also partly in the Midwest states of Nebraska, Kansas, and South Dakota, generally encompassing the western part of the Great Plains before the region reaches the Rocky Mountains. The High Plains are located in eastern Montana, southeastern Wyoming, southwestern South Dakota, western Nebraska, eastern Colorado, western Kansas, eastern New Mexico, the Oklahoma Panhandle, and the Texas Panhandle.[4] The southern region of the Western High Plains ecology region contains the geological formation known as Llano Estacado which can be seen from a short distance or on satellite maps.[5] From east to west, the High Plains rise in elevation from around 1,800 to 7,000 ft (550 to 2,130 m).[3]. The term ""Great Plains"", for the region west of about the 96th or 98th meridian and east of the Rocky Mountains, was not generally used before the early 20th century. Nevin Fenneman's 1916 study, Physiographic Subdivision of the United States,[6] brought the term Great Plains into more widespread usage. Prior to 1916, the region was almost invariably called the High Plains, in contrast to the lower Prairie Plains of the Midwestern states.[7] Today the term ""High Plains"" is usually used for a subregion instead of the whole of the Great Plains..
Thought 7: The High Plains rise in elevation from around 1,800 to 7,000 ft. So the elevation range for the area that the eastern sector of the Colorado orogeny extends into is 1,800 to 7,000 ft.
Action 7: Finish[1,800 to 7,000 ft]

Oranjegekte was initially confined to a few days in the year reserved for celebrations of the monarchy, until it expanded to include sports events.[3] Festivities were usually organized at the local level by neighborhood associations and Oranjeverenigingen (""Orange associations"") and supported financially by the government. Notable events include the January 1937 wedding between Juliana of the Netherlands, then the Dutch crown princess, and Bernhard of Lippe-Biesterfeld; in Emmen and other places festivities lasted until the start of World War II.[4].

Observation 5: Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is a 1964 children's novel by British author Roald Dahl. The story features the adventures of young Charlie Bucket inside the chocolate factory of eccentric chocolatier Willy Wonka.[1]. The story was originally inspired by Roald Dahl's experience of chocolate companies during his schooldays at Repton School in Derbyshire. Cadbury would often send test packages to the schoolchildren in exchange for their opinions on the new products.[2] At that time (around the 1920s), Cadbury and Rowntree's were England's two largest chocolate makers and they each often tried to steal trade secrets by sending spies, posing as employees, into the other's factory—inspiring Dahl's idea for the recipe-thieving spies (such as Wonka's rival Slugworth) depicted in the book.[3] Because of this, both companies became highly protective of their chocolate-making processes. It was a combination of this secrecy and the elaborate, often gigantic, machines in the factory that inspired Dahl to write the story.[4].
Thought 6: ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" could be considered a variation on a popular anecdote of a child winning a golden ticket to visit a mysterious candy factory. This book has sold over 20 million copies.
