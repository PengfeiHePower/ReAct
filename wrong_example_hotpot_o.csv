Schwarzenegger also served as the film's executive producer and plays himself as the actor portraying Jack Slater.

Much of Lee's best-known work is as part of the popular singing quartet known as The Mellomen, founded by Thurl Ravenscroft.[1]  It was Lee, rather than Ravenscroft, who provided Shere Khan's sung line during ""That's What Friends Are For"" in The Jungle Book.

The breed is generally healthy, although dogs can be affected by several inheritable genetic disorders.

More recent breeding has focused on the Collie as a show dog, and also companion. The breed specifications call for a distinctive long narrow tapered snout and tipped (semiprick) ears, so some dogs have their ears taped when young. Rough Collies generally come in shades of sable and white (sometimes mahogany), blue merle, tri-coloured, and colour-headed white.. Originating in the 19th century,[1] the breed is now well known through the stories of author Albert Payson Terhune about his dog Lad, and later with Eric Knight's character of Lassie and her novels, movies, and television shows..
